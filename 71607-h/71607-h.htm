<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Temerarious indeed must he appear who
attempts to comprehend in so small a space the
admirable actions of a Hero who filled the whole
earth with the fame of his glory, and who, by the wonders
he worked in our own days, effaced the most lofty and
astounding deeds of Pagan demigods and illustrious
Personages of Antiquity. But what encourages me to
attempt a thing so daring is the preciousness of the
material with which I have to deal; being such that it
needs neither the workman nor his art for the heightening
of its value. So that, however little I may say of the
incomparable and inimitable actions of the great Armand
de Richelieu, I shall yet say much; knowing also that
if I were to fill large volumes, I should still say very
little.”</p>
</div>

<p>Although the courtly language of the Sieur de la
Colombière, Gentleman-in-Ordinary to Louis XIV., who
wrote a <i>Portrait</i> of Cardinal de Richelieu some years
after his death, may appear extravagant to modern minds,
there is no denying that he is justified on one point—the
marvellous interest of his subject.</p>

<p>Few harder tasks could be attempted than a complete
biography of Richelieu. It would mean the history of
France for more than fifty years, the history of Europe
for more than twenty: even a fully equipped student<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</span>
might hesitate before undertaking it. At the same time,
Richelieu’s personality and the times in which he lived
are so rich in varied interest that even a passing glance
at both may be found not unwelcome. If excuse is
needed, there is that of Monsieur de la Colombière:
“Pour peu que j’en parle, j’en dirai beaucoup.”</p>

<p>There are many good authorities for the life of
Cardinal de Richelieu and for the details of his time,
among which the well-known and invaluable works of
M. Avenel and of the Vicomte G. d’Avenel should
especially be mentioned. But any modern writer on the
subject must, first and foremost, acknowledge a deep
obligation to M. Hanotaux, concerning whose unfinished
<i>Histoire du Cardinal de Richelieu</i>, extending down to
the year 1624, one can only express the hope that its
gifted author may some day find leisure and inclination
to complete it.</p>

<p>The birth of Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu—The position of
his family—His great-uncles—His grandfather and grandmother—His
father, François de Richelieu, Grand Provost of Henry III.—His mother
and her family—His godfathers—The death of his father.</p>
</div>


<p>In the year 1585, when Elizabeth of England was at
the height of her power, when Mary of Scotland
lay in prison within two years of her death, when
Philip of Spain was beginning to dream of the Invincible
Armada, when Henry of Guise and the League were
triumphing in France, the future dominator of European
politics was born.</p>

<p>Armand Jean du Plessis, third and youngest son of
François du Plessis, Seigneur de Richelieu, was an infant
of no great importance. Even his birthplace, for a long
time, was not known with any certainty.</p>

<p>His family was noble, but not of the higher nobility
which governed provinces, commanded armies, and glittered
at Court. He belonged to that race of French country
gentlemen which led a strenuous life in the sixteenth
century, either for good or evil—perhaps mostly for evil.
They were generally poor, proud, and greedy. If, by fair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
means or foul, they could capture a rich wife of their
own station, so much the better; if not, they readily sacrificed
birth for money, and bestowed an old name, coat
and sword, rough manners and ruinous walls, on some
heiress of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>. When the resource of marriage
failed, such a gentleman would turn himself into a mercenary
soldier, Catholic or Huguenot, or creep into Court
employment in the shadow of some great noble of his
province; or failing such honest means, he might clap on
a mask and take to highway robbery, rich travellers being
better worth pillaging than the peasants who hid in their
hovels as his horse’s heavy hoofs clanked by. Sometimes
Religion herself, or the false Duessa who personified her
in those days, might help a needy gentleman to a livelihood.
There was many an abbot who had never been a
monk; and there were lucky families—that of Du Plessis,
for instance—who possessed a bishopric as provision for
a younger son.</p>

<p>The Du Plessis were an old family of Poitou. In that
ancient and famous province they had held several fiefs
so far back as the early thirteenth century; but they were
a wandering, fighting race, without strong attachment, it
seems, to their native soil. One of them is said to have
gone to England in the suite of Guy de Lusignan, and
to have married a noble English wife. Another journeyed
to Cyprus with the same distinguished patron. In the
Hundred Years War, two Du Plessis brothers were found
fighting on opposite sides, French and English. Pierre,
the elder, head of the less distinguished branch of the
family, was a robber of Church property as well as a
traitor to the national cause; but in the way of morals
there was not much to choose between him and his brother
Sauvage, the patriot, in favour of whom their father threatened
to disinherit him.</p>

<p>Sauvage was a man of strong, acquisitive character,
and everything prospered in his hands, though he began
his career by carrying off a younger brother’s wife. It
was his son, Geoffroy, who laid the real foundation of
future greatness by his marriage with Perrine Clérembault,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
of a good old family, whose brother was Seigneur
of Richelieu. Louis de Clérembault, who held a post in
the Court of Charles VII, left his fortune and estates to
François du Plessis, his sister’s son. The young man
not only succeeded to the fortified château of Richelieu
and a good position in his native province, but also to a
connexion with the Court which lasted into the reign of
Louis XI, and which helped him to lift his family a step
higher by marrying his own son, François, to the daughter
of Guyon Le Roy, of Chavigny, in the Forest of Fontevrault,
a distinguished courtier, and Vice-Admiral of France under
François I. This François du Plessis de Richelieu was
great-grandfather to the famous Cardinal.</p>

<p>An ecclesiastical turn—for the sake of gain rather than
of godliness—was given to the family by its relationship
with that “true prelate of the Renaissance,” Jacques Le
Roy, uncle of Madame de Richelieu. He was successively
Abbot of Villeloing, Cluny, and St. Florent-de-Saumur,
and Archbishop of Bourges, and in him the bad sixteenth-century
alliance between the Church and the world, the
consequence of royal nomination to benefices, might be
seen at its most flourishing point.</p>

<p>He chose three out of his five Richelieu great-nephews
to follow in his footsteps. Two of them rose to be abbot
and bishop; the other, Antoine, took the vows as a monk
at Saumur against his will, and after a short religious life
varied by floggings and other punishments for rebellion,
unfrocked himself and ran away to the wars. Known
throughout his military life as “the Monk,” he was a cruel
and ferocious soldier. With his brother François, a man
of very different type, he first saw service in the Italian
campaigns under the Maréchal de Montluc. Both brothers
returned to Poitou towards 1560, and both took the Catholic
side in the religious civil war which raged for years
in the miserable western provinces of France, where
Protestantism, from various causes, had taken a firm hold.
Attached to the Guise faction, the brothers became special
partisans of the Duc de Montpensier, the King’s lieutenant
in Poitou and their own near neighbour at the Château de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
Champigny. His army swept the province with fire and
sword, and among his many fierce and adventurous
followers François and Antoine du Plessis-Richelieu led
the way.</p>

<p>The former, however, seems to have been an honest
soldier rather than a bloodthirsty demon. He, nicknamed
“<i>le Sage</i>” and regretted as “un fort brave gentilhomme,”
lost his life in an expedition against the English, who had
occupied Le Havre. <i>Le Moine</i> survived his brother some
years, and his fame as a fighter became worth a post at
Court and a knightly order. With an ever-growing
reputation for vice and violence, he was killed in a street
brawl in Paris—“mort symbolisante à sa vie,” says the
chronicler l’Estoile. His most characteristic exploit, and
the most startling among many, was the single-handed
massacre of a hundred Huguenots who had taken refuge
in a church near Poitiers. Antoine de Richelieu “amused
himself” by shooting down these poor defenceless creatures
in cold blood.</p>

<p>So much for the Cardinal’s great-uncles. His grandfather,
Louis du Plessis, Seigneur de Richelieu, the eldest
of the family, died a young man, but not before he had
helped on its fortunes by a marriage profitable in dignity,
if not in coin. The heir of Richelieu was of a quieter
spirit than his brothers. He entered the household of
a fine old noble—Antoine de Rochechouart, seneschal
of Toulouse, distinguished for valour in the reigns of
Louis XII and François I—as lieutenant of his bodyguard;
and very shortly married his master’s daughter,
thus distantly connecting his famous grandson with one
of the noblest old ducal families in France, from which
sprang Madame de Montespan and her brilliant brothers
and sisters, the Duc de Vivonne, Madame de Thianges,
and the learned Abbess of Fontevrault. His Rochechouart
grandmother was the one precious link between Cardinal
de Richelieu and the higher nobility.</p>

<p>M. de Rochechouart was poor, probably extravagant,
and his daughter Françoise, whom tradition makes neither
young, pretty, nor amiable, seems to have lived in a sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
of dependence on the great Dame Anne de Polignac,
dowager of La Rochefoucauld, at Verteuil, where Charles V
was royally entertained in 1539. These circumstances may
account for the <i>mésalliance</i> which Mademoiselle de Rochechouart
certainly made in marrying Louis du Plessis.
Her interest gained him the Court appointment of <i>échanson</i>,
or chief butler, to Henry II. But he was neither clever
nor prudent, and his widow was left with five young
children, very little money, a sharp, proud temper, and a
deep discontent with her lot in life.</p>

<p>She settled herself at Richelieu, then only a small castle
on an island in the river Mable, in the heart of a country
terribly disturbed by civil war, and commanded, from the
neighbouring hills, by the strongholds of unfriendly neighbours.
Here she brought up her children, of whom the
second son, François, was the father of Cardinal de
Richelieu.</p>

<p>The story goes that a tragic event made François lord
of Richelieu. There was a feud, centuries old, between
the Du Plessis in their moated castle and the family of
Mausson, perched upon the hill. The quarrel had been
in abeyance during the peaceable, absentee life of Louis
du Plessis, but when his proud widow, with her haughty,
passionate boys, took up her abode at Richelieu, it broke
out again furiously. Louis, the eldest son, was just
growing into manhood, an officer in the Duc de Montpensier’s
guards, when he fell out with the Sieur de
Mausson over that ancient bone of contention, a seat in
church.</p>

<p>Both families attended the village church of Braye,
on the forest slope close by. In those days, and long
afterwards, the chief gentleman in the parish had rights
over the church quite as jealously guarded as any other
of his feudal privileges. He sat with his family high up
in the choir. He ordered the hour of mass, and the curé
did not venture to begin before he arrived. The congregation
followed his lead throughout. When he was absent,
his servants sat in his place and insolently demanded the
honours due to him. His coat of arms was hung up for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
all to see. If he died, the bells chimed unceasingly for
forty days, and the church was hung with black velvet
for a year and a day.</p>

<p>It appears that the Sieur de Mausson and the young
Seigneur de Richelieu both demanded honours which
could not be paid to both. The young man, pushed on
by his mother, made an angry resistance to the Mausson
claims. His neighbour, by way of settling the question,
lay in wait for Louis and murdered him.</p>

<p>Madame de Richelieu thought of nothing but revenge.
Her younger son, François, was page to King Charles IX.:
she sent for him, and he lived at Richelieu, mother and
son with one object, one intention, till the watched-for
time came. Then one day, when Mausson was fording
the river, François and his men rushed out from the
shadow of the willows. They had set a cunning trap for
the enemy, a cart-wheel hidden under water, and while
his restive horse was plunging, they fell upon him and
killed him. So ended the feud between Mausson and
Richelieu, still a lingering tradition in the valley of the
Mable.</p>

<p>There was not much justice in those days, but it
appears that François was obliged to fly the country.
He wandered as far as Poland, where Henry of Anjou
was playing at being King, and shared in the adventures
of that most worthless of the Valois when he ran away
with the Polish crown jewels and travelled round by
Austria and Venice to succeed Charles IX on the throne
of France.</p>

<p>François de Richelieu became Henry’s trusted servant.
Certainly there was nothing of the <i>mignon</i> about him.
Very tall, thin, solemn and dismal, his looks were suitable
to his dreary but necessary office—first Provost of the
King’s house, then Grand Provost of France, charged with
arresting malefactors and presiding over their punishment.
He was known at Court as “Tristan l’Hermite,”
so that he must have struck his contemporaries as resembling,
not in his office alone, the famous Provost of
Louis XI.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>François de Richelieu was affianced in early youth,
before the Mausson affair drove him abroad, to Suzanne
de la Porte, who belonged by birth to the higher <i>bourgeoisie</i>
of his native province. Circumstances brought about
this marriage, to which one cannot imagine that the
proud Françoise de Rochechouart gave a very willing
consent.</p>

<p>The family of La Porte, highly respectable, and clever
with all the Poitevin shrewdness, possessed estates in
Poitou and elsewhere. François de la Porte, the Cardinal’s
maternal grandfather, was a brilliant scholar at the
University of Poitiers, only second in fame to that of
Paris, and first in Europe for the study of Roman law
in the original spirit; keen, solid, logical, practical.</p>

<p>François de la Porte became a learned and distinguished
advocate in the law-courts of Paris, but did not lose
interest in his own province and his neighbours there.
He appears to have been specially concerned with the
affairs of Louis de Richelieu, who, according to Tallemant,
was not only very poor, but “embrouilla furieusement
sa maison,” and left his family in real distress. M. de la
Porte made himself very useful to Dame Françoise de
Richelieu, no doubt partly as to the management of her
more distant property, difficult enough in those desperate
times, and satisfied the vanity with which his contemporaries
credit him by marrying his daughter to her son.
The exact date of the marriage does not seem to be
known.</p>

<p>As Grand Provost, François de Richelieu had a house
in Paris, in the Rue du Bouloy, and all probabilities point
to the fact of his son Armand having been born there.
He was certainly baptized in Paris, though not till eight
months after his birth, the delay being caused partly by
his extreme delicacy, partly by the long and dangerous
journey from Poitou which had to be made by his grandmother,
who was present at the church of Saint-Eustache
as one of his sponsors.</p>

<p>The others were two Marshals of France, Armand de
Gontaut-Biron and Jean d’Aumont; each of whom gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
the child a name. Both these gallant soldiers are celebrated
by Voltaire in the <i>Henriade</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="fr">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“D’Aumont, qui sous cinq Rois avoit porté les armes;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Biron, dont le seul nom repandoit les alarmes....”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Both were intimate friends of the Grand Provost, and
joined him later in placing their swords at the command
of Henry IV.</p>

<p>The name of François de Richelieu is frequently to
be met with in the documents of Henry III.’s reign.
He received the highest honour Royalty could bestow,
the Order of the Holy Spirit. The King’s personal safety
depended largely on him, and allowing for the general
corruption of the time, he seems to have performed his
duties, often secret and mysterious, with honesty, loyalty,
and courage. On that wild day in 1588, when the Duc
de Guise had been welcomed by Paris with mad enthusiasm,
when the streets were chained and barricaded against the
King’s troops, and Henry was escaping from his “ungrateful
city,” it was the Grand Provost who checked the
pursuers at the Porte de la Conférence. Old writers say
that the gate took its name from that circumstance, and
tell how “François de Richelieu, Grand Prévôt de France,
père du Cardinal de même nom, arrêta les Parisiens qui
vouloient suivre le Roi, pour tâcher de le surprendre.”</p>

<p>Luckily for his own fame, this “wise officer” was not
an active agent in the murder of the Duc de Guise at Blois,
a few months later. But he was sent to the Hôtel de
Ville to arrest those dignified citizens whom the King
suspected of being concerned in the Guise conspiracy.
And in the following summer he performed his last duty
towards Henry III. by arresting the miserable monk,
Jacques Clément, whom the Duchesse de Montpensier,
sister of Guise, had persuaded to earn his salvation by
murdering the King, “enemy of the Catholic religion.”</p>

<p>In the confusion that followed Henry’s death, the wise
“Tristan” did not trust himself to the faction of the
Guises. With other Catholic nobles, and in spite of
family traditions, he turned to the one man in whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
hands he saw safety for France and himself, the Protestant
Henry of Navarre. That clever Prince received him
cordially and confirmed him in his appointments. So it
came to pass that the nephew of “the Monk” reddened
his sword with Catholic blood at Arques and at Ivry,
and followed his new King, still as Grand Provost of
France, to the camp before Paris. There his career was
cut short by a fever in the summer of 1590, at the age
of forty-two.</p>

<p>Friends and relations—The household at Richelieu—Country life
in Poitou.</p>
</div>

<p>Whether the widow of François de Richelieu was
in famine-stricken Paris during the siege—one of
those afflicted ladies to whom the good-natured
and politic Henry sent provisions first, passports later,
that they might escape from the city—or whether she had
already, her husband being so strongly in opposition to
the ruling powers there, removed herself and her five
children into the country it seems impossible to know.</p>

<p>She was not without influential friends in Paris; the
more useful, perhaps, because they were not in the fighting
line. Her father lived in the Rue Hautefeuille, near the
Church of St. André-des-Arcs, in the heart of the Latin
quarter; the old turrets of his house still remain. He
was divided from the Rue du Bouloy, on the north side
of the river beyond the Louvre, by two bridges, the
Island, and a labyrinth of dirty, narrow, dangerous streets.
There may well have been a gulf fixed, during those
horrible months of the siege, between the old advocate
and his daughter.</p>

<p>But Amador de la Porte, his younger son, and Denys
Bouthillier, his head clerk and future successor, were not
likely to let Suzanne and her children suffer any unnecessary
privation. Both were strong and brilliant men,
worthy members of that <i>bourgeoisie</i> which was the pride
and life of Paris. Amador, some years younger than his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
sister, was apparently too restless to settle down in his
father’s profession. But François de la Porte had been
very useful, as advocate, to the Order of Malta. They
rewarded him by receiving Amador as a Knight of the
Order, without a too close inquiry into his proofs of
nobility. His foot once on the ladder, Amador rose to
be Commander, then Grand Prior of France, and by his
nephew’s favour held several important governments.</p>

<p>These two men, Amador de la Porte and Denys
Bouthillier, were constant friends and guardians of the
Richelieu children. Bouthillier and his sons were devoted
to the Cardinal throughout his career, to their very great
advantage. Claude, the eldest, made an enormous fortune
as <i>surintendant des finances</i> under Louis XIII., and his son
Léon, Comte de Chavigny, was a minister under both
Richelieu and Mazarin. Sébastien and Victor rose high
in the Church. Denys became private secretary to Queen
Marie de Médicis, and was created Baron de Rancé; he
was the father of Armand Jean de Rancé, the famous Abbot
of La Trappe.</p>

<p>Through the Cardinal’s other La Porte uncle, of whom,
personally, not much is known, the old advocate’s family
stepped up into something like equality with the highest
in the kingdom. His son, Charles, a bold, eccentric
creature, attached himself from the first to the fortunes
of his cousin, Armand de Richelieu, and by this means
became a Marshal of France and Duc de la Meilleraye.
He was one of the Cardinal’s most trusted aides-de-camp,
and later on, a conspicuous figure in Paris during the
troubles of the Fronde.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1590, if not sooner, a family of women
and children was established at the Château de Richelieu.
There were Dame Françoise de Rochechouart, widow of
the Seigneur Louis, and her daughter, also a widow,
Françoise du Plessis, Madame de Marconnay. There were
Suzanne de la Porte, widow of the Grand Provost, and
her five children; Françoise, a girl of twelve—who married
first the Seigneur de Beauvau, secondly, René de Vignerot,
Seigneur du Pont-de-Courlay, and was the mother of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
Cardinal’s favourite niece, Madame de Combalet, afterwards
created Duchesse d’Aiguillon; Henry, a well-known
courtier of Louis XIII.’s young days; Alphonse, at this
time intended for the Bishopric of Luçon; Armand Jean,
the political genius, now a delicate, feverish atom of five
years old; Nicole, who married the Marquis de Maillé-Brézé,
and whose daughter, Claire Clémence, became the
wife of the great Condé.</p>

<p>The head of this household, according to immemorial
French custom, was the grandmother, Françoise de Rochechouart.
Her rule, no doubt, was severe, and there are
evidences that her daughter-in-law, a woman of gentler
type, suffered under it. The hard old aristocrat who had
condescended in her marriage with Louis du Plessis was
scornful of the <i>bourgeoise</i> mother of her grandchildren.
She was soured too by the losses and troubles of her
life. Probably Suzanne brought from Paris the habits
of a civilisation that did not suit that rough old home,
that “ancient house of stone, roofed with slates,” strongly
fortified with walls and moats as useful now as in the
time of the English wars, when they were new. In 1590,
the civil wars were by no means at an end. The province,
devastated for years by Catholics and Huguenots flying at
each other’s throats, now suffered equally in the struggle
between Henry IV. and the League. Poitiers took the
latter side, and for three years, from 1591 to 1594, the
King’s army besieged it in vain. All the neighbouring
country, including the valley of the Mable, was ruined
and unsafe. A band of ruffian soldiers sacked the small
town of Faye-la-Vineuse, on the hills overlooking Richelieu.
No wonder if the gentle Suzanne, “loyal lady” and tender
mother, was kept sleepless by burning horizons as often as
by her little Armand, shivering with fever in the unwholesome
mists of that river valley.</p>

<p>Her anxieties indeed were many; for though Dame
Françoise might be mistress of the house, all the business
connected with her children and her inheritance devolved
on her. And the Richelieu affairs were in an embarrassed
state. The Grand Provost had left heavy debts behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
him. There was the management of various small estates
and châteaux in Poitou, which by some means or other
had become possessions of the family: one of these was
Mausson, name of ill-omen, which had been taken in
exchange for an estate in Picardy, part of the dowry of
Suzanne de la Porte.</p>

<p>She was an excellent woman of business, with hereditary
instincts of law and order. All her tact and capacity,
directed by strong affection, were devoted to the interests
of her children. The words she wrote to Armand, years
later, when he was Bishop of Luçon, seem to have been
the key-note of her life:</p>

<p>“L’inquiétude que j’ai me tue et je vois bien que je
n’aurai jamais de joie que lorsque, vous sachant tous
heureux, je serai en paradis.”</p>

<p>With such a mother, and with an indulgent aunt in
Madame de Marconnay—in spite of a fierce grandmother,
barred gates and alarms of war—the children’s life at
Richelieu need not have been unhappy. Indeed it was not
so, if one may judge by the Cardinal’s recollections of it,
and his constant devotion to the old place where most of
his childhood was spent. After all, the family was on
the winning side. France was growing tired of the
League, attracted by the sunny, accommodating patriotism
of Henry IV. If the harvests of Poitou were destroyed,
woods cut down, villages burnt and pillaged, it was often,
odd as this may sound, the work of friends, and in the
intervals of these stormy visits of robber bands, country
life went on cheerfully.</p>

<p>The strong old manor nestled snugly on the islet in
the river-bed, something after the fashion of Chenonceaux
in Touraine or Bazouges in Anjou. On the border of
these two provinces and of Poitou, the country round
Richelieu had something of the character of all three.
The rich fertility of Touraine, the vineyards and gardens,
though not unknown here, soon gave way to the forests
and marshes of the wilder provinces. But Richelieu had
its park and its avenues, leading from the high road which
ran south from Chinon and Champigny into Poitou. By<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
this road came all the travellers, all the visitors: Amador
de la Porte, the beloved uncle, with news from Paris;
Jacques du Plessis, the great-uncle, the non-resident Bishop
of Luçon, with his eye on a young successor; or, less
welcome to the heads of the family, the Duc de Montpensier,
the feudal neighbour, with his pack of wolf-hounds
and swaggering troop of guards and followers. One may
fancy, even then, that the dark eyes of Armand watched
the owner of Champigny, scarred from the wars, without
much friendliness.</p>

<p>There are signs that the family at Richelieu was on
kindly terms with its neighbours of lower estate. The
curé of Braye, M. Yver, who said mass often in the chapel
of the château, was an intimate friend. There was no
oppression of the peasants, who lived round about in their
low, mud-floored, one-roomed cottages, and eked out their
poor harvest by catching game in the forest or fishing in
the river. All through the western provinces, indeed,
then and for long afterwards, seigneur and peasant lived
well together; the contrary was the exception. And the
contrary came to pass, in great measure, through the
action of the founder of absolute monarchy, the boy who
ran about hand in hand with his mother at Richelieu.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Dame Suzanne befriended and
doctored the people, knew them all by name, visited them,
gossiped with them. She and her children witnessed their
marriages, were sponsors at the baptism of their babes;
a few years later, in 1618, the old registers of Braye bear
witness that the infant son of young Henry du Plessis
was named at the font, in the chapel at Richelieu, by two
“poor orphans,” assisted by “ten other poor persons.” The
gates of the château were open to any humble neighbours
who suffered in the wars; the kitchen supplied them with
food, sometimes not too plentiful even there; and holy-days
found the courtyard full of peasants playing their
bagpipes, dancing their quaint provincial dances, singing
the songs of Poitou. Thus masters and servants alike
managed to forget the hardships and terrors of the time.</p>

<p>Among scenes like these the Cardinal’s early childhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
was spent, and to his dying day, with all France at his
feet, he loved that corner of Poitou. It must be added
that the traditions of Richelieu itself, supported by many
writers of the seventeenth century, declare that he was born
there. When Mademoiselle de Montpensier, in 1637, paid
her visit to Madame d’Aiguillon at the magnificent palace
into which the Cardinal had transformed the little stronghold
of his fathers, and found some of the rooms inconceivably
small and mean, compared with the stately
exterior, it was explained to her that the Cardinal had
ordered Le Mercier, his architect, to preserve unaltered
that part of the old building where his parents had lived
and where he was born. The witnesses on the same
side are too many to quote. On the other hand, Richelieu
himself declared on more than one occasion that he was
born in Paris, a Parisian, a native of the city which always
had his heart; and his enemies dwelt strongly on the
same fact, treating the Poitevin theory as an outcome of
that immense pride and vanity which encouraged the
Cardinal’s worshippers to represent his family and their
possessions as older and greater than they really were;
feudal magnates of centuries, instead of country gentlemen
with their fortune to seek.</p>

<p>The University of Paris—The College of Navarre—The Marquis du
Chillou—A change of prospect—A student of theology—The Abbé de
Richelieu at Rome—His consecration</p>

</div>

<p>Before Armand de Richelieu was eleven years old,
his uncle Amador, who was among the first to
recognize the boy’s brilliant gifts, carried him off
to Paris and placed him at the University. It was the
family intention that Armand should carve out his living
in a career of arms. The eldest brother, Henry, the
seigneur of Richelieu, was to marry, and to cut a figure
at Court. Being a charming and agreeable young fellow,
he was likely to succeed in this line. Alphonse was a
saint, and a born ecclesiastic; his future needed no
arrangement; the see of Luçon was waiting for him.
After the death of the great-uncle, Jacques du Plessis, in
1592, the revenues of the diocese were taken over by
a titular bishop—no other than M. Yver, curé of Braye
and chaplain at Richelieu—a worthy warming-pan who
paid the largest portion to Madame de Richelieu, and
wasted as little as possible on the cathedral and the
diocese. The canons rebelled and complained most unreasonably,
we are told; but Henry IV. had confirmed
Henry III.’s grant of the bishopric to the Richelieu family,
and the Chapter could obtain no redress. They had to
wait till Alphonse was of age to be consecrated.</p>

<p>It was the right thing for every young Frenchman, of
every rank, whatever his future walk in life might be, to
go through his course at one of the universities. A king’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
son might be found on the Paris benches, listening to the
same lecture with the clever son of a tradesman or even
a peasant from a remote province. The poor students
were quite as numerous as the rich; they filled the high
houses and crowded the narrow streets of the famous
Pays Latin; they “lived as they could,” and their
character as a community did not alter much in the course
of centuries.</p>

<p>When Armand de Richelieu was first entered at the
College of Navarre, where “the great Henry” had
studied before him, the University was at a low ebb, both
as to professors and students. The wars of the League,
the fighting in the streets, the horrors of the siege, had
driven most decent people away from Paris, while armies
of vagabonds and fugitives took possession of the city,
even of that “city within a city,” which the University
had been ever since the time when Philippe Auguste
built its enclosing wall.</p>

<p>That wall still existed long after the young days of
Richelieu. Its broad ditches, its battlements and frequent
towers, its seven or eight formidable gateways, two of
which defended a bridge and a ferry over the Seine, while
the Tour de Nesle, at the western corner, frowned across
at the Louvre—all enclosed with mediæval strength that
Latin quarter, a half-moon in shape, which sloped up,
a mass of lanes, colleges, convents, churches, to the old
royal abbey and Church of Ste. Geneviève, where her
shrine, the chief religious treasure of Paris, was kept;
destroyed in the eighteenth century and replaced by the
Pantheon with Voltaire’s bones and Soufflot’s ugly dome.</p>

<p>The University existed before the colleges. They were
founded, one by one, by charitable men and women, mostly
for the benefit of the poor scholars of different special
towns or countries. Often their names told their story;
but sometimes they were called by the name of the
founder, such as the “Collège du Cardinal Lemoine.”</p>

<p>The College of Navarre was one of the best known
and highest in reputation. It was founded in 1304 by
Jeanne, wife of Philippe le Bel and Queen of Navarre in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
her own right, in memory of the victory of Mons-en-Puelle
in Flanders. It was thus nearly three hundred years
old when Armand de Richelieu entered it, and had already
that royal and military reputation which lasted through
three or four centuries more. An old writer on Paris
says that the sons of the greatest nobles in the kingdom
boarded in this college, and in order that they might not
be distracted by intercourse with outside students—a real
danger, one would think, and of worse things than distraction—no
other scholars were received. “Navarre”
did not always remain so exclusive. But this was
probably its character in Richelieu’s time, though we do
not positively know whether the young gentleman, with
his private tutor and his footmen—all of whom remained
many years in his service—lodged in the college or at
his grandfather’s house in the Rue Hautefeuille.</p>

<p>The College of Navarre had had famous men among
its tutors and professors. Nicolas Oresme, one of its
early head masters, was tutor to King Charles V., who
owed to him his surname of “The Wise.” He was a
translator of Aristotle, and is supposed to have made the
first French version of the Bible. Somewhat later, the
celebrated mystic, Jean Gerson, believed by many to be
the real author of the <i>Imitatio Christi</i>, was a teacher in
the college and became Chancellor of the University. A
famous Principal, also Chancellor, was Cardinal d’Ailly,
Archbishop of Cambray, a theologian of tremendous
strength, known at the Council of Constance as the
“Eagle of France,” and “the Hammer of the Heretics.”</p>

<p>The traditions of “Navarre” were inspiring and severe.
At the end of the sixteenth century, when young Richelieu
was going through its courses of “grammar” and “philosophy,”
the college was ruled by Jean Yon, a lover of
Cicero, of discipline, and of Church ceremonies. Long
after the days of dry study and compulsory Latin were
over, the Cardinal kept a friendly recollection of his old
master, and declared that he could never see him without
“a feeling of respect and fear.” Probably, therefore, Jean
Yon was wisely careful to hide his admiration of the boy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
who, according to one of his biographers, “avala comme
d’un trait toute la grammaire,” knew by instinct how to
baffle his examiners by puzzling counter-questions, and
dazzled both teachers and comrades by the bold and
sparkling flashes of his genius.</p>

<p>But Master Yon was not always the stern pedagogue.
The Cardinal ever remembered with peculiar pleasure
taking part, as a singing boy, in the great procession which
marched from Ste. Geneviève on her hill, right across
Paris, to visit the tomb of St. Denis. The whole University
joined in the procession, and on this occasion it was
led by Jean Yon and a chanting choir from the College of
Navarre.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, they say, that procession was so
long that when the head was entering the Church of
St. Denis, far away in the northern outskirts of the city,
the tail, of great dignity, had not yet come forth from
the Church of the Mathurins, where the general rendezvous
had been fixed. This was in the time of Charles VI.,
when all Paris was praying and making processions that
his lost senses might be restored to him. In those days,
we are told, the University of Paris was the centre of
learning for all the nations of Europe and the mother of
all their universities, including “Oxfort en Angleterre.”
Her European fame and the number of her students had
dwindled a good deal before the day when Armand de
Richelieu, the slim, keen, black-haired boy of twelve,
marched in her procession as an <i>enfant de chœur</i>.</p>

<p>Down the hill they wound, threading the dark labyrinth
of high college walls, then perhaps following the Rue
St. Jacques, the old Roman road, down to the Petit
Châtelet, guarding with its tunnelled gateway the entrance
to the Petit Pont; or, more likely, keeping to their own
Latin-speaking quarter as far west as the Pont St. Michel—the
Pont Neuf was not yet finished—and there crossing
to the Island and passing in front of the Palais de Justice,
through crowds of men of law, red-robed councillors,
officials and hangers-on of the Parliament, quite as busy
and as noisy as the ecclesiastical throng they had left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
behind them. The Pont-au-Change, haunt of money-changers
and bird-catchers, carried them on to the farther
shore; one of those steep and ancient bridges, chiefly
built of wood and blocked with houses, shops and stalls,
which were difficult to cross at all times and were
constantly in danger from flood or fire. Then the
procession’s way was almost blocked by the great round
towers and frowning prison walls of the Grand Châtelet.
Then through dark and narrow ways it passed out into
the wider spaces, the gayer air, of the Paris of the north
bank, of kings and their palaces, and leaving the Louvre to
the left, the Hôtel de Ville, Bastille, and Temple far to
the right, went on by the Rue St. Denis towards the
gate of that name, and so out into the frequented road
leading to the old towers that sheltered the shrine of the
Saint.</p>

<p>All the way there was a constant carillon of bells from
a hundred steeples; the red and gold of vestments and
banners glowed in the sunshine; trumpets brayed; and
with loud chanting the procession paced along. To a boy
fresh from his lessons, who was to live on into more
colourless times, such a holiday glimpse of the Middle
Ages may very well have been a pleasant recollection.</p>

<p>At this time young Richelieu was looking forward to
nothing but the life of a soldier, and of course a mercenary
one, for his family was likely to endow him with little
means of living. The world was his oyster, which he
with sword must open. It was nothing new: he would
walk in the footsteps of his father and his great-uncles,
with the advantage of serving a King whom he heartily
admired; of this his Memoirs give proof enough.</p>

<p>When the usual University course was over, M. de la
Porte proceeded to make a man and a soldier of his
nephew. He placed him at the famous Academy of
M. de Pluvinel, a former companion-in-arms of the Grand
Provost, who had made a career for himself as a trainer
of young gentlemen. He taught them fencing, riding,
dancing, music, mathematics, various manly games. He
was an authority on fashion and style, wit and manners,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
the ways of foreign nations; in short, he turned boys fresh
from college into men of the world, courtiers, soldiers,
diplomatists. There was scarcely a leading man in France
in the early seventeenth century who had not passed
through the “manège royal” of M. de Pluvinel.</p>

<p>A title was necessary, in order to swagger successfully
among the gay <i>cadets</i> of the Academy. Armand became
Marquis du Chillou, taking the name from a small estate
in Poitou brought into the family by his great-grandmother.</p>

<p>His years of study at the Academy seem to have been
among the happiest of his life. Made mentally of steel and
flame as he was, ancestral hardness and strength of will
joined with a passionate ambition all his own, the fighting
career of a successful soldier was likely to attract him
irresistibly. When he was young, it seemed indeed the
one chance of shining in the world, of commanding men.
And he never lost his love for the profession he had to
renounce, though it became clear that for a daring spirit
such as his, the red robe was as practical a garment as the
buff coat. “Sous le prêtre, on retrouve toujours en lui le
soldat,” says M. Hanotaux.</p>

<p>There was one drawback to the military prospects of
Armand de Richelieu. The delicate, aguish boy had not
grown into a strong youth. His keen spirit was now, as
ever, a sword too sharp for its frail sheath. Hard study
and lack of fresh air during his college days had had
their likely effect on his weak constitution and slight frame.
For his sake, his mother did not mourn over the family
circumstances that forbade him, after all, to be a soldier.
“Mon malade,” as she called him, was not of those who
could sleep on open field or fell, in mud or mire, as
soundly as within stone walls with curtains round his
bed.</p>

<p>For the family, it was a question of losing the revenues
of the see of Luçon. Alphonse de Richelieu, its intended
Bishop, at the age of nineteen or twenty, turned away in
disgust from the worldly-wise arrangement, and decided
to become a Carthusian monk. It may not be unfair to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
describe him as “dévot et bizarre”; but one seems to see
in this singular resolution an outcome of the reaction
against the dead and conscienceless state into which the
sixteenth century had brought the French Church; the
reaction which was already living and moving in such men
as François de Sales, Vincent de Paul, Pierre de Bérulle,
though leading them, as to their religious life, into reforming
action rather than lonely contemplation.</p>

<p>Armand’s choice was soon made. No doubt the change
was to him inevitable. There could not be two young
men more different than himself and Alphonse; yet he
too had a conscience of his own, of the truly Latin kind
which demands any and every sacrifice for the sake of
the family. He is said to have written to his uncle, who,
one may well believe, was sincerely sorry for him: “The
will of God be done: I accept all, for the good of the
Church and the glory of our name.” The latter aspiration,
at least, was fulfilled.</p>

<p>At seventeen, in the year 1602, the Marquis du Chillou
laid down his sword and his title, left M. de Pluvinel’s
Academy and returned to the University. A year or
two later, there was no more eager student of philosophy
and theology than the Abbé de Richelieu. There are
merry stories of the time which suggest that he and his
private tutor M. Mulot, afterwards his chaplain, were
concerned in wild pranks, such as robbing gardens and
orchards, which would have been impossible under the
strict discipline of old Master Yon. There is a pretty
legend which tells that the Cardinal, in his last days,
sent for an old college gardener whose peaches he had
stolen—the good man’s name was Rabelais, and he came
from Chinon—and paid him a large sum of money as
compensation for being both robbed and frightened: at
that time, an unlucky wretch who was summoned before
the Eminentissime went in very reasonable fear of his life.</p>

<p>The sober University, in its clock-work course, hardly
knew what to make of Armand de Richelieu. He swallowed
theology as he had swallowed grammar, and the ordinary
progress of learning was far too slow for him. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
studying independently with several learned masters, especially
with Richard Smith, an Englishman, of the University
of Louvain, afterwards Vicar Apostolic in England, he was
ambitious to hold a public disputation at the Sorbonne.</p>

<p>The doctors of that reverend foundation refused the
unusual request; but Richelieu, who ardently desired to
become an adept in controversy, persuaded his old College
of Navarre to be less timidly narrow and conservative.
Here the lad of nineteen, worn to a shadow by studying
hard eight hours a day, set forth his thesis and defended
it against all comers. The listeners were slightly uneasy,
for his argument was based rather on philosophy than
on strictly theological grounds, and was indeed flavoured
by the influence of Jansenius, who came to Paris about
this time. But the long struggle between Gallicans and
Ultramontanes, Bishops and Jesuits, was only at its
beginning, and Jansenism proper was not born; the
sixteenth century had known little more than the fiercer,
simpler quarrel between Catholics and Protestants, the
heretic and the faithful. As a fact, in his own original
way, Richelieu held all the doctrines approved and taught
by the Sorbonne.</p>

<p>There was every reason why the future Bishop should
hurry on his theological studies. The Chapter of Luçon
had completely lost its patience; and this is not surprising,
for both the cathedral and the episcopal palace were falling
into ruins, while no money could be extracted from
M. Yver and Madame de Richelieu, until, at last, a decree
of the Parliament forced them to provide for the necessary
repairs. If the bishopric was to remain in the Richelieu
family, Armand must be consecrated with as little delay
as possible.</p>

<p>He was not yet near the canonical age of a bishop.
He had, however, been ordained deacon in 1606, and early
in that year, while he was still hurrying through his last
examinations, King Henry wrote to his Ambassador at
Rome, recommending the Abbé Armand Jean du Plessis,
royally nominated to the bishopric of Luçon, to the favour
of His Holiness Paul V., and praying for an early consecration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
on the ground of the young man’s “mérite et
suffisance,” which were such as to make the legal delays
morally quite unnecessary.</p>

<p>Such dispensations were common enough, but this one
was slow in coming. Paul V., the Borghese Pope, had
not long been elected, but was already known for his
determined will and strong sense of duty. He was not
a man who would lightly break through any laws or
customs of the Church, and certainly not to please King
Henry IV., whose conversion he distrusted and whose
way of life he condemned. The Abbé de Richelieu,
hearing nothing from Rome, resolved to wait no longer.
In the autumn of 1606 he left Paris and travelled hard
to Rome, very impatient, and quite sure that if he could
once gain the Pope’s ear and plead his own cause, it
would speedily be won.</p>

<p>He was not mistaken, though Paul V. received him
coldly on his first introduction by the Ambassador: a
self-confident, presumptuous boy who expected to be
ordained priest and consecrated bishop at twenty-one, was
not likely to meet with instant favour from an elderly,
legal-minded martinet. Various tales are told, by friends
and enemies, as to the means by which Richelieu quickly
gained his ends at the Papal Court. Some say that he
added a year to his age, or falsified the date of his
baptism, and that the Pope, hearing too late of the trick,
observed, “This young man will be a great knave.” On
the other hand, it is said that, struck with admiration
of Richelieu’s genius, the Pope made no difficulty,
saying, “It is just that one whose wisdom is above his
age should be ordained under age.” On the whole, the
latter story seems the more probable; but neither has
any real foundation.</p>

<p>It is certain, at any rate, that the Abbé de Richelieu
made the best use of the months he spent at Rome, and
convinced Paul V., himself a clever man, that King Henry’s
praise was not undeserved. He preached before the Pope,
and his ready learning and splendour of diction were considered
miraculous. He carried on arguments with His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
Holiness on the morals of Henry and other subjects, so
firmly yet so respectfully that Paul was altogether charmed.
He studied the spirit of Rome, that mysterious city which
was at once “the capital of the Catholic world and the
centre of the civilized, world.” As the centre of an older
world still, of ancient history and pagan art, Rome had
not the same attraction for him. All that was to come
later, when the Cardinal attempted, without great success,
to pose as one of the chief art patrons in Europe.</p>

<p>At this time, his whole mind was given to present
advancement, and his intuition as to his own interest was
faultless. He learned Italian and Spanish, he courted the
Cardinals and other dignitaries, and while dazzling his
company with all the light French brilliancy of his young
wit, he pleased them by the gentleness and modesty he
knew well how to assume. Thus he saved himself from
much envy and jealousy which might have nipped his
career at the outset.</p>

<p>On April 17, 1607, Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu,
aged twenty-two years and seven months, was ordained
priest and consecrated bishop by the Cardinal de Givry,
who had always been his friend. The suffering diocese
of Luçon was no longer without a head, and the Roman
Easter bells rang in one of the greatest figures in French
history.</p>

</div>

<p>The diocese of Luçon—in itself one of the least desirable
in France—had to endure some months more
of neglect before its new Bishop came into residence.</p>

<p>Richelieu’s return to France, in the early summer of
1607, was a return to Paris and the University, which
now saw the unusual sight of a bishop among its students.
There were still examinations to pass and distinctions to
gain: the theological honours of the Sorbonne were not
lightly bestowed, even on a dignitary of the Church. But
Richelieu, once more, triumphantly satisfied his examiners,
and in the autumn of 1607 he was admitted to the degree
of Doctor of the Sorbonne. One may say that the old
institution was his mother and his child. She trained the
brain that transformed France and directed Europe; she was
made illustrious by his munificent care, and his feverish
life at last found rest in the shadow of her walls.</p>

</figure>

<p>In the winter of 1607-8, Henry IV. was at the height
of his power and popularity, although certain dreamers,
prophets of evil, necromancers, and such-like creatures
of the darkness, suggested that his useful reign was near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
its end. For whatever the immoralities of his life may
have been—and they had a fatal influence on society—his
political ends and means were excellent. His favourite
dream was of a general European peace with religious
toleration: and one need only realize the state of France
a hundred years later—populations crushed by cruel
taxation and dying of famine by thousands—to see what
the difference might have been if Henry and Sully could
have worked their will for twenty years more, keeping
the nobles in check, insisting on justice, studying and
carrying into practical effect the means of making the
country prosperous by useful public works, by careful
training in agriculture and other industries. Under Henry
and his minister—who did not, however, share his master’s
popularity—farming was encouraged, rivers were made
navigable, bridges were built, waste lands were reclaimed,
new roads were made, new crops, such as potato and
beet-root, were introduced, a labourer’s tools were safe
from seizure for debt. France was beginning to breathe
after long horrors of civil war: feudal oppression was
passing away, and the country generally was on the eve
of better things, under the eye of a King who, absolute
as he certainly meant to be, loved his people and wished
them well. All was doomed to fall to pieces with the
death of Henry, followed by the regency of a stupid
woman and the new policy of Richelieu.</p>

<p>Henry was himself the centre point of Paris, the beloved
city, which he made his home, only leaving the
Louvre for visits to Saint-Germain and Fontainebleau, or
for hunting excursions in the country. Small, active, carelessly
dressed, ever on the move, the Parisians saw their
King among them at all seasons, all hours, riding or driving
in the streets, equally eager after business and amusement;
gambling at the famous Fair of Saint-Germain—held during
the early months of the year on the left bank of the Seine—or
planning with Sully, within the walls of the Arsenal,
those economies and financial rearrangements which
gained him the reputation of being a miser. Henry was
a curious character, half a hero, made of gold and of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
clay; but his Parisians, as a rule, saw little but the gold.
He was a familiar sight among them, the frank, good-natured
man, with his rosy cheeks, long nose, and whitening
beard and hair. They loved him because he was affable,
kind, easy-going, polite, and yet could be stern and royal
enough when any one displeased him. They loved his keen
interest in the city, shown by plans for rebuilding and
improving, some of which were already carried out when
he died, while some lingered on into the days of Richelieu.
His favourite works were the Grande Galerie of the Louvre,
the Pont Neuf, the Hôtel de Ville, burnt by the Commune,
and the Place Royale, now known as Place des Vosges.</p>

<p>The Court at the Louvre, under a King impatient of
etiquette—except when Parliament or Protestants had to
be awed, or foreign ambassadors received—seems to have
been lacking in dignity. It had not the splendour, the
mystery, the romance and cultivation, however evil, of the
Valois; nor had it the stiff magnificence of an absolute
Louis XIV. The tone of the Court, in fact, was <i>bourgeois</i>;
and it is curious enough that the early seventeenth century
in England, as well as in France, had this intimate flavour
of something like vulgarity. James I. cracked coarse jokes
with his courtiers and slapped them on the back. Henry IV.,
though a far more intelligent man, encouraged the same
kind of manners among his jovial companions at the Louvre.</p>

<p>The King and Queen quarrelled perpetually, and in
public. The young Bishop of Luçon, admitted at Court
not only by the means of his elder brother, a popular
courtier, but through the King’s personal liking for him,
saw with his own eyes scenes to which the Cardinal de
Richelieu alluded in his Memoirs, dictated many years
later. With all his enmity towards Marie de Médicis, he
had to acknowledge that the King’s love-affairs, result
of the besetting weakness of a great prince, might justly
have irritated a woman less naturally jealous, proud and
unforgiving. As one intrigue succeeded another during
the whole of Henry’s later life, and as the Queen could
never be brought to take these things meekly, it follows
that peace seldom reigned at the Louvre. Henry, on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
side, turned the tables on his wife by injurious suspicions
almost certainly without foundation, and the Duc de Sully
himself told Richelieu that he had never known a week
pass without a quarrel. On one occasion, in passionate
anger, Marie raised her hand to box Henry’s ears! “M. de
Sully stopped her so roughly that her arm was bruised,
crying out with an oath: ‘Are you mad, Madame? He
could have your head off in half an hour. Have you lost
your senses, not to remember what the King can do?’
The King went out; and after much coming and going
he (Sully) appeased them both. Afterwards, the Queen
complained that the Duc de Sully had struck her.”</p>

<p>Sometimes these quarrels had a comic side. The Queen
would refuse to dine as usual with the King, and would
order a small table to be brought into her cabinet. On
these occasions the good-tempered Henry, who never
could be angry long, and who preferred living at peace
with a wife he did not really dislike, would send her
choice morsels from his table, even from his plate. If
Marie’s temper had not reached the level of accepting a
peace-offering, she would coldly return the dainties. Court
gossip declared that she was afraid of poison.</p>

<p>In his book on Marie de Médicis, M. Batiffol gives a
curious description, drawn from old records, of the royal
dinner at the Louvre when the King and Queen dined
together.</p>

<p>No one sat at the table with them, but a privileged
public, including the whole Court, crowded the room.
The Swiss guards stood round the table, bearded, fierce,
German-speaking warriors, “old servants of the Crown,”
leaning on their halberds, dressed in velvet, white, blue,
and red. Six gentlemen served their Majesties, taking
the dishes from the “officers of the kitchen,” who brought
them into the room. The <i>menu</i>, a very considerable one,
was drawn up by the Queen’s <i>maître d’hôtel</i> and counter-signed
by herself. Sometimes, generally on Sundays only,
the King’s musicians gave a concert during dinner. As
a rule, there was a good deal of conversation. The King
and Queen talked to the courtiers who stood in ranks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
behind the Swiss Guard; not of “affairs,” but of any
light and interesting subject that might occur.</p>

<p>On such an occasion the King may well have shown
special favour to a young man in episcopal purple, of
middle height, very thin, with black hair, a delicate, pointed
face, keen dark eyes, under a broad brow full of intelligence,
quick to catch and respond to every slightest glance from
Royalty. Young Richelieu—“My Bishop,” Henry called
him—may have had stories to tell of his Roman experiences,
stories pleasing to the King, who had taken the trouble
to push his fortunes; and the wit, the memory, the
reasoning power, which amazed the Sorbonne, may also
have been noticeable at the Louvre.</p>

<p>Sometimes the talk led on to thin ice, and Richelieu
knew it: for instance, when the King reminded him of
certain things he had written about the Maréchal de Biron,
his godfather’s son, beheaded for conspiracy in 1602. It
was a lesson as to giving a handle to jealous enemies,
which Richelieu did not soon forget.</p>

<p>Dinner over, the Queen returned to her dogs and
monkeys and parrots, her gaming, card-tricks and music,
or walked in the garden, or drove in the city, perhaps
visiting her divorced predecessor, Queen Marguerite de
Valois—large, self-indulgent, with a flaxen wig—who led
an extravagantly immoral but literary and charitable life
in Paris, the adopted sister and aunt of the Royal family;
perhaps driving out to Saint-Germain to see the children,
who lived there, a large household, legitimate and otherwise,
under the care of the Baronne—afterwards Marquise—de
Montglat.</p>

<p>The King too, though never forgetful of public business,
had his amusements of many kinds—gambling, hunting,
building, making love. Sometimes he and the Queen
dined out together in Paris, frequently with M. Zamet,
banker and money-lender and Henry’s very faithful servant,
at his palatial hôtel in the Marais. Sometimes they
delighted the Parisians by sharing their amusements in
the streets and on the bridges—jousts, sham fights in
masquerade, running at the ring. Then were to be seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
the young nobles of France, infected with Henry’s own
dash and daring recklessness, flinging themselves so
desperately into these mock battles that real wounds
were given and lives were lost. The famous Baron de
Bassompierre, chief of the “dix-sept seigneurs,” leaders
of fashion, to whose exclusive ranks Henry de Richelieu
also belonged, was nearly killed in one of these encounters
in the paved court of the Louvre.</p>

<p>Hardouin de Péréfixe, tutor to Louis XIV. and afterwards
Archbishop of Paris, wrote for his pupil’s instruction
a history of his royal grandfather, Henry the Great.
Drawing on his own memory, or something very near it,
he sketched the state of society at the beginning of the
century. While the King and his ministers were working
hard in lifting their country out of the slough of war and
abject misery, most of the nobles were finding mischief
for their idle hands to do. The Memoirs of Bassompierre
and others prove that Péréfixe told less than the truth:
he was too courtier-like, too careful of offending young
royal ears, to give much idea of the brutality of manners
which existed in the society of Henry IV. and Marie de
Médicis; but he describes vividly the temper of the men
among whom Armand de Richelieu, clever, poor, observant,
shielded by his elder brother’s popularity, was growing
into manhood.</p>

<p>“The French noblesse,” says Péréfixe, “being at peace,
could not be doing nothing; some spent their time in
hunting; some in the company of ladies; some studied
<i>belles lettres</i> and mathematics; others travelled in foreign
lands; others kept up the exercise of war under Prince
Maurice in Holland. But many, with itching hands, eager
to show off their courage without leaving home, became
punctilious, and at the least word, or at crossing glances,
had their swords in their hands. Thus a mania for duels
seized on the minds of gentlemen. And these encounters
were so frequent that the nobles shed nearly as much blood
between themselves as their enemies had made them lose
in battle.”</p>

<p>Royal edicts, one after another, had little effect in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
cooling these hot spirits; especially as Henry usually
forgave a crime which his laws threatened with forfeiture
of life and goods. In the following reign such laws were
less of a mockery, as the nobles found to their cost.
Louis XIII. was made of harder stuff; and Richelieu had
learnt by personal experience—his brother’s death in a
duel with the Marquis de Thémines—the need of a strong
hand.</p>

<p>There was not much personal distinction, at this time,
among the grandees of France. Henry de Bourbon, Prince
de Condé, nearest in blood to the throne, was a shy,
gloomy youth, mean in looks and character, and though
really clever and ambitious, eccentric to the verge of madness.
“Monsieur le Prince,” says Brunet, “père du grand
Condé, s’imaginoit être quelque fois oiseau et d’autres
fois sanglier, et se cachoit sous les lits et sous les tables
comme s’il avoit été dans les forêts.” It was not till 1609,
after Richelieu had retired to his diocese, that King
Henry, for his own ends, married this young man to the
marvellously beautiful Mademoiselle de Montmorency.
Then, to the King’s rage and disgust, Condé proved that
he had some individuality, and ran away with his wife to
Flanders. But for the dagger of Ravaillac, a European
war might have followed on this elopement.</p>

<p>François de Bourbon, Prince de Conti, the King’s first
cousin, uncle of Condé, brother of Henry’s old companion-in-arms
and once himself a fighter, was elderly, deaf, and
incapable. He appeared little at Court, but lived in Paris
on the revenues of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés.
His wife, Louise Marguerite de Lorraine, a brilliant
mischief-maker, with her mother, the lively old Duchesse
de Guise, widow of Henry le Balafré, was among the
few really intimate friends of Queen Marie de Médicis.
Henry IV., who had once thought of marrying her, ended
by disliking her, resenting her influence over his wife.
But she kept her place at Court, and after the Prince de
Conti’s death she is said to have secretly married Bassompierre,
first of courtiers and her lover of many years.</p>

<p>Charles de Bourbon, Comte de Soissons, usually known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
as Monsieur le Comte, was the Prince de Conti’s half-brother,
his mother, Françoise d’Orléans-Longueville,
having been the second wife of Louis I., Prince de Condé.
Though outwardly loyal to Henry IV., he was perhaps
the most dangerous enemy the King had in his own
immediate circle. Ambitious, proud and violent, he never
forgave Henry for breaking an early promise of marrying
him to his sister, Catherine of Navarre. Jealous of his
own position, he resented every mark of favour shown by
the King, especially the honours showered on the young
Duc de Vendôme, Henry’s eldest legitimised son. If a
fit of the sulks had not kept Monsieur le Comte out of
Paris at the time of Henry’s death, he would have disputed
the regency with the Queen. Not being on the spot, he
was neither clever, strong, nor popular enough to disturb
the appointed order of things.</p>

<p>Henry de Bourbon, Duc de Montpensier—familiar to
the Richelieu family as lord of Champigny—was of no
account at all, in court or camp, during his later years.
But he had been an heroic soldier. Son of that Montpensier,
the leader and patron of “the Monk” Richelieu
and his brother, who swept Poitou with fire and sword
in the religious wars, and of his furious Duchess, the soul
of the League, the sister of Henry le Balafré, who brought
about the murder of Henry III., he, with so many other
Catholic princes and nobles, fought his uncles and the
League under the banner of Henry of Navarre. A terrible
wound in the face received at Dreux, where he commanded
a regiment of cavalry, brought Henry de Montpensier’s
public career to an end at twenty-seven. His life, after
this, was one of more or less suffering. He fell out of
favour for some time with the King, being suspected of sympathy
with the Biron conspiracy. He married, in middle
life, his cousin Henriette Catherine de Joyeuse, another of
the Queen’s intimate friends, and they had one daughter,
born in 1605, the heiress of all the immense Montpensier
possessions; by her marriage with Gaston of France the
mother of the famous Anne Marie d’Orléans, Duchesse de
Montpensier, commonly known as La Grande Mademoiselle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>M. de Montpensier appears to have lived a great deal
at Champigny, a favourite among his many châteaux.
Thirty years after his death, on her way to visit the new
splendours of Richelieu, his granddaughter found that he
was still beloved there, although the almighty Cardinal,
levelling his house with the ground, would gladly have
destroyed his memory.</p>

<p>The Duke died at his hôtel in Paris on the last day
of February 1608, wasted by a long decline, and devotedly
nursed to the end by his eccentric Capuchin father-in-law,
Père Ange, in the world Duc de Joyeuse. “Bon prince,”
l’Estoile says of Montpensier, “and as such regretted and
mourned by the King, the nobility and all the people.”
The usual amusements of the Carnival were stopped; even
the little Dauphin was not allowed to dance his ballet
before the King. Three weeks later a funeral service was
held at Notre Dame, with an oration by the popular
preacher M. Fenouillet, Bishop of Montpellier. The
ceremony, which was simple, derived dignity from the
presence of one hundred and twenty poor men in long
robes, carrying torches. Another and grander service was
held in April. Between these two occasions, the last male
descendant of Robert, son of Saint Louis, was conveyed
with an escort of three hundred horse to Champigny, and
was buried in the chapel which still exists there.</p>

<p>The Duc de Montpensier’s widow married Charles,
Duc de Guise, who, with his brothers, represented the
princely House of Lorraine at the French Court. By birth
and position, of course, he was one of the first men in
France; personally he was of little account, and hardly
a worthy descendant of the great Dukes of the sixteenth
century. He had not even their looks, being short and
snub-nosed. He was witty, agreeable and generous,
very frivolous and a great flirt. Richelieu, in the first
volume of his <i>Memoirs</i>, gives Henry IV.’s own estimate
of this head of the Guise family: “Plus de montre que
d’effet”; rather brilliant in company, and judged capable
of great things by those who did not know him; but
so slothful and lazy that he cared for nothing but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
pleasure, “et qu’en effet son esprit n’était pas plus grand
que son nez.”</p>

</figure>

<p>Among the more conspicuous nobles, the Duc de
Bouillon, the malcontent leader of the Protestants, was
a constant thorn in the King’s side. The Duc d’Épernon,
an ambitious, adventurous courtier of Gascon origin, had
been a favourite of Henry III., and was not much loved
by Henry IV., who did not trust him. His son, Bernard,
married Gabrielle-Angélique de Bourbon, the King’s
daughter by the Marquise de Verneuil. This alliance
was roughly declined by the old Duc de Montmorency,
Constable of France, to whom Henry proposed it for his
splendid young son, that Henry de Montmorency, last of
the direct line, whose high head was among those to be
mown down, at a future day, by the implacable Cardinal.</p>

<p>Among left-hand Royalties, the oldest was Charles de
Valois, Comte d’Auvergne, afterwards Duc d’Angoulême,
a man of a certain courage and humorous charm, but
foolish, dishonest, and unlucky. He was the son of
Charles IX. and Marie Touchet, who married the Comte
d’Entraigues after the King’s death, and became the
mother of Henriette d’Entraigues, Marquise de Verneuil,
Henry IV.’s passion and the special abhorrence of Marie
de Médicis. In a fit of jealous fury, and in the supposed
interest of her children, Madame de Verneuil intrigued
with Spain against Henry. It was only the King’s enduring
infatuation which saved her half-brother, the Comte
d’Auvergne, from losing his head. As it was, he spent
ten of his best years, from 1606 to 1616, shut up in the
Bastille.</p>

<p>Henry’s own son by Gabrielle d’Estrées, Duchesse de
Beaufort, the legitimised prince who was first known as
César-Monsieur, then created Duc de Vendôme, was the
spoilt favourite among his children. No more odious
young fellow was to be found in France. Spiteful, of
vicious tendencies, “c’est un mauvais drôle, violent,
moqueur, brutal.” There was every probability that César,
whom the King openly preferred to his little lawful son,
the future Louis XIII., would one day be the most powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
of all the princes. Henry had already arranged a
marriage for him with a rich heiress of royal blood,
Françoise de Lorraine, only daughter of the Duc de
Mercœur.</p>

<p>Such were the bearers of some of the grandest old
names in France, during the last years of Henry IV.’s
reign. Hardly one of these men had any influence on
affairs, either of the court or the nation. Concini and his
wife, the Queen’s Italian favourites, were powerful at the
Louvre and lived splendidly, though they worked chiefly
behind the scenes as long as Henry lived. The Duc de
Sully, with his royal friend and master, governed the
kingdom. His wise white beard, his strict and careful
management of the finances, demanded and obtained respect.
This clever and obstinate Huguenot was certainly
the best-feared man in France. He was also cordially hated
for his grim, uncompromising manners, his impatient scorn
of all courtly weaknesses and extravagances. But he was
the one great statesman in France, beside whom the other
ministers were of no account, and he would have laughed
aloud, in the year 1608, if any one had prophesied coming
disgrace in his ears: an honourable disgrace, it is true,
but never to be retrieved; while, equally incredible, the
young bishop of an obscure diocese was to wield a power
beyond his own most ambitious dreams.</p>

<p>Paris was an unpleasant place of abode in the winter
of 1607-8, when Armand de Richelieu was engaged in
making his way at Court. According to L’Estoile, the
weather was extremely indisposed, “nebulous, damp and
unhealthy.” Great and small alike suffered from “force
cathairres, avec force petites véroles, rougeoles, et pourpre:”
from which many died, among others the Duc de Bouillon’s
daughter. People died suddenly of suffocation on the
chest, the season being “tellement desreiglée” that it
rained perpetually day and night. The terrible gloom was
made responsible for horrid crimes of all sorts. The new
year brought so severe a frost that men, women, cattle
and birds died of cold in the fields about the city, or
were partially frozen and maimed for life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>Evidently the Bishop of Luçon was among the sufferers
from this abnormal season. He was obliged to excuse
himself, on account of illness, from obeying the King’s
command to preach before the Court at Easter. After this
disappointment, he was ill in bed for about four months, as
we know from his letters to M. d’Alincourt, son of the Duc
de Villeroy, Henry’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, who had
actively befriended him as ambassador in Rome. Richelieu
was not ungrateful, and there is something more than
worldly politeness in these graceful, sincere letters, written
from his sick room to welcome M. and Mme. d’Alincourt
back to Paris and to lament that his “fascheuse maladie”
hinders him from hastening to kiss their hands.</p>

<p>In the late autumn of the same year the claims and
grumblings of Richelieu’s far-off diocese at last made
themselves effectively heard. There may have been other
reasons for his rather hasty departure in dark December
days. The doctors may have advised country air as
a help towards shaking off an almost chronic state of
fever. Or possibly, after so long an absence from Court,
his place in the royal favour may have seemed less secure,
and he was not rich enough to buy influential friends.
Or Henry, who liked men to do their duty, may have
given a hint too plain to be neglected.</p>

<p>In any case, having borrowed four horses and a coachman,
the Bishop of Luçon left Paris behind him, and
started on his long unpleasant journey to the dreary
marshes of Lower Poitou.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Richelieu arrives at Luçon—His palace and household—His work
in the diocese—His friends and neighbours.</p>
</div>

<p>While his coach rumbled and jolted through miry
ways towards the south-west, Armand de
Richelieu had time to consider what he had done
and hoped to do. The objects of his ambition were always
the same: political power and the command of men. His
career might seem to have met with a sharp check in
these long months of illness, followed by banishment to
remote wilds, so far from the sources of light and of
favour, Paris and the King. But if he felt this, he was
not the man to be seriously disheartened.</p>

<p>A diocese, after all, is not a bad school for governing
one’s fellow-creatures. Some of Richelieu’s biographers
think that he deliberately took up the work of a resident
bishop with the idea of gaining experience for the larger
career on which his heart was set: some, that in his state
of chronic poverty he found the provinces a more honourable
abode than the capital. In any case, he threw himself with
eager energy into work which was difficult enough; the
province of Poitou, and especially Lower Poitou, being
desolated and devoured by war and by taxes, torn to
pieces by schism, unhealthy, dismal, neglected, its old
traditions, both of Church and State, fallen into ruin and
forgetfulness. And Luçon itself, with its fine old cathedral
lifted proudly and sadly above the mouldy roofs of the
<i>bourg</i>, neither town nor village, seemed to lie at the other
end of the world, near upon the sea, beyond leagues of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
wide wet marsh scattered with miserable little farms and
cottages and crossed by half-drained roads and stagnant
canals, the few wretched peasants shivering with fever.</p>

<p>The occasional visits of Jacques du Plessis de Richelieu,
who had now been dead sixteen years, were Luçon’s latest
experience of episcopal care. Certainly the diocese owed
nothing to the Richelieu family, which had swallowed
its revenues and let its cathedral tumble down; but with
a touching faith in the future not unjustified, it offered
a hearty welcome to young Armand de Richelieu. He
entered his territory at Fontenay-le-Comte, a cheerful
little town which prided itself, like the rest of Poitou, on
having produced many great men. The Bishop was
received here, not only by the inhabitants, but by a
deputation from the Chapter of Luçon, and they harangued
each other with various flattering remarks. But through
the formalities of the time there pierces that clear decided
meaning which is never absent from any utterance of
Richelieu’s, even as a young man of three-and-twenty.
His speeches were never written for him. There were
anger and injury in the minds of the Luçon Chapter, and
he knew it. “I am not happy enough,” he said, “to have
all your hearts.” But now that he and they were to live
together, things would be very different. They would
learn to know him, and to wish him well. For his part,
he was ready to forget the past, highly esteeming the
law which the ancients called “amnistie d’oubliance.”
Possibly there was a wry face here and there among the
old canons at this touch of generosity, and it was not
very long, in fact, before they began to quarrel with their
new Bishop; but he had brought with him from Paris
the fame of a preacher and a theologian, and the dull
little town was <i>en fête</i> on that saint’s day in December
when Richelieu first said mass and preached in his own
cathedral.</p>

<p>All, indeed, seemed peace and harmony. Even the
Protestants, who were rather numerous in the diocese
and in all that part of France, had a friendly word from
the new Bishop on his arrival. One of the speeches which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
has been preserved was addressed to the crowd in the
street. After telling them how much he valued their
joyful faces and cries of welcome, he added, “I know there
are those in this company who are divided from us as to
belief; in spite of which, I hope we may be united in
affection, and I will do all that is possible to bring this
to pass.”</p>

<p>Here one seems to see the germ of that idea of religious
toleration which influenced Richelieu’s policy in later years.
If he could persuade the Huguenots to be “Frenchmen
first and Protestants afterwards,” he was always willing
to give them liberty of worship. If he crushed them, it
was because they were a fighting faction which endangered,
in his view, the unity of France and the power of the
monarchy.</p>

<p>From his dilapidated palace, the heavy old buildings
of which leaned up against cathedral walls battered by
wars and by weather, Richelieu wrote in the spring of
1609 to a certain Madame de Bourges, who lived in Paris,
in the Rue des Blanc-manteaux, near the newly fashionable
Place Royale. This lady seems to have been a friend of
his mother’s family, and to have been married to one
of a succession of distinguished physicians who practised
in Paris during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
She was certainly an obliging person. Possibly her
husband or son had attended the young Bishop in his
four months’ illness.</p>

<p>He begins his letter by thanking Madame de Bourges
for a million kindnesses, and especially for some ecclesiastical
vestments she had sent him. He found himself
badly off for many necessary ornaments, former bishops
of Luçon having left little behind them. And no wonder:
they had not made it their residence for sixty years, we
are told, and fighting Huguenots had stormed and
devastated the place.</p>

<p>“... I am now in my barony,” he writes, “beloved of
everybody, so they tell me, and I can only repeat it; but
you know all beginnings are good. I shall have no lack
of occupation here, I assure you, for everything is in such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
ruins that repairing will be hard work. I am extremely
ill-lodged, for I have no fire anywhere, because of the
smoke ... no remedy but patience. I assure you that
I have the most horrid bishopric in France, the most
muddy and the most disagreeable.... There is no place
to walk, no garden, no alley, no anything, so that I am
imprisoned in my house....”</p>

<p>He is immensely interested in his furniture and his
household, showing in these young days all the taste
for careful detail, all the love of magnificence and show,
which was to characterise the great Minister, the man
with millions to spend where a poor little Bishop of Luçon
had only hundreds.</p>

<p>He tells Madame de Bourges, of whose kind and active
interest he seems very sure, that he has bought the velvet
bed belonging to his aunt, Madame de Marconnay. He
has also come into possession of a stately bed with hangings
of silk and gold, which belonged to his great-uncle,
“deffunct M. de Luçon.” This style is out of fashion,
apparently, for he asks advice and help as to arranging
the episcopal bed with Bergamesque tapestry. A little
later, he concludes that even a beggar like himself must
entertain his neighbours with a noble air, so that the
country may esteem him “un grand monsieur.” He will
therefore be obliged to Madame de Bourges if she will let
him know the cost of two dozen silver plates “de belle
grandeur.” He hopes to get them for five hundred crowns,
but seems pretty sure that his kind friend will make up
any deficiency: “I know that for the sake of a hundred
crowns you would not let me have anything mean.”</p>

<p>In return for all these services the Bishop was expected
to interest himself in finding a husband for Madame de
Bourges’ daughter Magdeleine. The task was not easy:
he assures his correspondent that there is not a gentleman
in the country possessing either money or goods. “Nous
sommes tous gueux en ce pays, et moi le premier,” he
says with a light-hearted air.</p>

<p>From the first he was very fortunate in his servants,
several of whom came to him at this time and stayed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
him all his life. One of these was his <i>maître d’hôtel</i>, a
young man named La Brosse, who had been in the service
of the late Duc de Montpensier. La Brosse ordered everything
in the household, knew how the Bishop’s guests
should be entertained, and troubled him with nothing
but accounts. This was well, for the work of the diocese,
once undertaken, was enough to occupy both thought and
time.</p>

<p>The destitution of the flock was twofold—bodily and
spiritual. Richelieu’s first care was to get his poor people
relieved of some of the heavy burden of taxes which weighed
them down. Under the system of those days, France was
divided into <i>pays d’états</i> and <i>pays d’élection</i>. The <i>pays d’états</i>—chiefly
provinces which had been originally independent of
the crown of France—were taxed by their own representative
Estates, sitting at the principal town. The <i>pays d’élection</i>
were assessed by crown officials, who farmed out the
taxes to local companies; and among the provinces thus
farmed was that of Poitou.</p>

<p>The system meant local greed, dishonesty and oppression;
the small townspeople of such a place as Luçon
and the country-folk of its poverty-stricken neighbourhood
had no redress from the tax-gatherers of Poitiers. The
worst burden of all was the direct tax known as <i>la taille</i>.
A man paid this on all his possessions in money and kind,
and it always amounted to a quarter of his property, sometimes
to a great deal more. The clergy and nobles were
exempt from <i>la taille</i>, which crushed the poor peasants
and the smaller people to the earth.</p>

<p>In later years, Louis XIII.’s Minister was ready enough
to tax these suffering millions for the sake of absolutism
and glory; but the young Bishop of Luçon, not yet
hardened by power, touched by the piteous sight of thin
hands worn by toil, the bread snatched from them by
those who made an unfair living out of the taxes, wrote
to head-quarters at Poitiers more than one letter of strong
remonstrance, letters in which a warm indignation pierces
through the studied courtesy of the words.</p>

<p>He writes of “the misery of the place, the poverty of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
the people, the excessive tax of the <i>taille</i> which they have
paid till now....” He begs that the load they have to
bear may be lightened. He reminds the officials that their
own town pays much less than it ought, and hints very
plainly that unless things are voluntarily set right, he
will call the higher powers of justice to his aid.</p>

<p>As one would naturally expect, the <i>traitants</i> of Poitiers,
worthy forerunners of the farmers-general of a later century,
took very little notice of the appeal or the veiled threat
of M. de Luçon—a young fellow, a “new broom,” who
might as well mind his own ecclesiastical business and
let the King’s taxes alone. But he was as good as his
word. Two months later he wrote to the Minister of
Finance, the all-powerful Sully, to lay the grievances of
his flock before him; the appeal being seconded by his
courtier brother, Henry de Richelieu. Thus the Poitevin
tax-gatherers had a taste of Richelieu’s quality.</p>

<p>The spiritual needs of the diocese were quite as crying
and as serious. Religious matters all over France were in
a terrible state, and nowhere worse than in Bas-Poitou.
“Error and vice were rampant,” says a writer of the time.
Where the Church was concerned, Christianity seemed
extinct; and Huguenot zeal had died down into political
discontent. Church property was misused, wasted on
pensions to princes and courtiers; the bishops were
worldly and non-resident, the monasteries were scandalously
corrupt, and their revenues often in lay hands; the parish
clergy were ignorant and poor, and the long civil wars
had made havoc with the churches; many had been
desecrated, put to profane uses, if not destroyed altogether.
It was only forty or fifty years since the “Monk” Richelieu
and men like him had stormed over Poitou, and the
memory of his exploits was still green.</p>

<p>The consequence of all this was a state of morals and
civilisation which has been described by Michelet—not
without exaggeration, possibly—in his terrible chapters
on witchcraft in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
Dark and cruel superstitions haunting the God-forsaken
villages; horrible Mumbo-Jumbo rites, relics of heathenism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
performed on lonely heaths or in the shadow of the forests;
families in which black magic and sorcery were handed
down from father to son, from mother to daughter—such
were the discoveries lying in wait for any active bishop
who visited his diocese in the year 1609.</p>

<p>Armand de Richelieu was such a bishop; and the
horror of these early experiences may partly explain
the Minister’s terrible severity, many years later, towards
Urbain Grandier, the unworthy priest who was accused
of bewitching the Ursuline nuns of Loudun.</p>

<p>During his residence, from 1609, with intervals, to 1614,
Richelieu threw all his young strength into the labour of
civilising and christianising Bas-Poitou. Travelling into
every corner of the province, he preached, confirmed,
scolded, advised, converted. Great and small had to
listen to his admonitions. His passion for order and
discipline brought new and amazing experiences to a
parish clergy which had lived as it listed, idle, drunken,
immoral, in the happy delusion that no one would ever
interfere. Richelieu interfered to some purpose.</p>

<p>One of his chief objects was to get the appointment
of the curés into his own hands. Many livings—if they
could be called so—were in the gift of private persons,
subject to an episcopal consent which was never refused:
others belonged to abbeys, and this often meant, in the
end, the patronage of some prince or noble to whom the
monastic revenues were paid. For instance, a hundred
benefices in the diocese of Luçon alone, and many more
elsewhere, belonged to the great Benedictine abbey of
Saint-Michel-en-l’Ermitage, of which the Comte de Soissons,
the King’s cousin, was the titular abbot. There is little to
be said in that prince’s favour; he was a man of “mœurs
infâmes”; but Richelieu, in later years his son’s bitter
and powerful enemy, had occasion to write M. le Comte
a quite grovelling letter of thanks in 1609. He had made
the Bishop his “vicar” with regard to all the clergy in
the diocese of Luçon who depended on the Abbey of
Saint-Michel.</p>

<p>Richelieu dealt with private patrons in a more plain-spoken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
way. “One called André” having been preferred
to a benefice by a great lady, Madame de Sainte-Croix,
the Bishop flatly declined to allow so incapable a man
“to lead a flock dear to Jesus Christ.” Yet, with all his
firmness, he was kind. If the patroness would set a good
example to the diocese by placing her living among those
to which, after careful examination, the Bishop undertook
to appoint the best men, he was willing that André should
try his powers with the rest. So strong, so wise and
religious, are the arguments of the letter, that its result
is not surprising. Madame de Sainte-Croix sent her
presentation to the Bishop <i>en blanc</i>. Nobody knows what
became of the unlucky André.</p>

<p>Richelieu was not satisfied with appointing his curés;
he was determined to educate them. Here he was moved
by the new spirit of the time, working so actively in the
Jesuits, led by the King’s confessor, Père Cotton, and no
less in Pierre de Bérulle, the evangelist, who had just
introduced into France the Congregation of the Oratory.
His second house in France, for the express purpose of
training men for the ministry, was established at Luçon
during these years of Richelieu’s residence. Bérulle, a man
of old family and of most lovable character, was at this
time an intimate friend and associate of the Bishop of
Luçon. There came a day of estrangement and political
enmity.</p>

<p>Richelieu’s provincial life was by no means solitary.
The young and sturdy Bishop of Poitiers, M. de la Rocheposay,
son of a bold fighter of the League and worthy
of his name, was a neighbour and friend of Poitevin
origin; and attached to both cathedrals there were men
of distinction, of theological science, burning with zeal
not only for the advance of religion and the conversion
of heretics, but for the honour and glory of the bishops
they loyally served. One of the grand vicars of M. de
Poitiers was no less a personage than Duvergier de
Hauranne, afterwards known as the Jansenist Abbé
de St. Cyran, the famous director of Port-Royal. One
of the canons, afterwards dean, of Luçon was Sébastien<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
Bouthillier, Abbé de la Cochère, to whose devotion and
cleverness, now and in later years, Richelieu owed much.
These young men, with others like-minded, fought hard
for the Catholic religion in their province of Poitou;
preaching, teaching, holding disputations with Protestant
ministers—a work in which the Bishop of Luçon, with his
learning fresh from the Sorbonne, distinguished himself
highly. They also had their “diversions” in common,
which consisted in hard study, keen argument, and
preparation for further spiritual conquests. As for real
spirituality of mind, there is no doubt that Saint-Cyran,
mystic, Augustinian, uncompromising, outstripped his
companions as far on that path as Richelieu did on another—the
path of political genius.</p>

<p>Luçon in its fever-haunted marshes did not keep the
Bishop long. He lived much at Coussay, a priory and
small château belonging to his family, in a more hilly
and healthy part of his diocese not so far from Poitiers.
He seems to have been happy here, away from his
quarrelsome Chapter and near his friends: the traditions
of Coussay, we are told, still preserve his memory; not
as the great Cardinal, but as “prieur et châtelain” of that
little village and domain. He was also a good deal at
Les Roches, another priory he possessed between Chinon
and Saumur, close to Fontevrault, in the north-west corner
of his diocese. Here he was very near his old home,
Richelieu, where his mother, aunt, and younger sister
were still living, the fierce old Rochechouart grandmother
having been some years dead.</p>

<p>At Les Roches, it seems, began the famous and lifelong
friendship between Armand de Richelieu and François
Le Clerc, Marquis du Tremblay, now a man of two-and-thirty,
thin, red-haired, deeply marked with the small-pox,
who had already made his name as Père Joseph, a
Capuchin monk of extraordinary talent and energy. The
future <i>Éminence grise</i> was Angevin by birth, had been a
soldier, but at twenty-two had thrown himself passionately
into “religion.” Before Richelieu came to Luçon, Père
Joseph was carrying on a valiant conflict of eloquence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
persuasion and violence combined, with the Protestants
throughout these western quarters, many of whom were
considerable by descent and actual power. Père Joseph
was attracted by difficulty. Whatever the truth about
his after life may be—history tells contrary tales—there
is no doubt that at this time he was an ardent reformer
in his own sense of the word and a man of deep personal
religion. It was owing to him, and to his friend the
Abbess of Fontevrault, Eléonore de Bourbon, aunt of
Henry IV., that a Capuchin convent was established at
Saumur in the teeth of the Protestant governor, Du Plessis-Mornay.
From this convent and others, notably Fontenay,
in the diocese of Luçon, Lent preachers were sent out
into all parts. Richelieu welcomed them with “extreme
joy.” But it was not till a year or two later, after King
Henry’s death, when his views and hopes were fast
extending beyond diocesan limits, that he and Père Joseph
found themselves working together in the difficult and
complicated affairs of the Abbey of Fontevrault.</p>

<p>“Instructions et Maximes”—The death of Henry IV.—The difficult
road to favour—Père Joseph and the Abbey of Fontevrault.</p>

</div>
<p>If some of those who were privileged to watch, with
short-sighted eyes, Richelieu’s apostolic work in the
diocese of Luçon, could have read his thoughts and
sometimes looked over his shoulder, they might have been
somewhat startled. Probably his contemporaries knew
nothing of certain rapidly scrawled sheets in the Cardinal’s
familiar writing, which were discovered by M. Armand
Baschet among the old manuscripts of the Bibliothèque
Nationale, about thirty years ago. The sheets are headed,
“Instructions et Maximes que je me suis donné pour me
conduire à la Cour.” At first the date was a little disputed;
but internal evidence seems to show that Richelieu wrote
these pages of notes in the winter of 1609, or early in 1610,
when at the background of his thoughts, apparently all
busy with evangelising Bas-Poitou, the desire for public
life and power was waxing stronger every day. It was
not likely indeed that such a young race-horse, keen,
nervous, swift and delicate in body and brain, would long
be contented to plough the heavy wastes of the muddiest
diocese in France.</p>

<p>In his hours of solitude he dreamed of King and Court,
and planned every detail of behaviour that might please
the great Henry. From an eastern window, one may
fancy, he gazed over the wide plains towards Paris, his
Jerusalem, the real centre of his worship, the goal of that
flaming ambition which, with him, largely usurped the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
place of all other passions. Then he wrote down his
dreams, so clear, so businesslike, so full of prudence and
self-control, that they could hardly fail to come true.
It would have been amazing if the genius that so vividly
pointed him the way had not led him to the height of his
desires.</p>

<p>It seems worth while to give a few extracts from this
curious <i>Mémoire</i> for the sake of the light it throws on
Richelieu’s mind. He changed very little until absolute
power made careful personal observation and dissimulation
unnecessary.</p>

<p>Through all his pages there is only one mention of
God or of religion; with this his first paragraph abruptly
begins.</p>

<p>“There is so much licence and there are so many kinds
of diversions, that if one does not give to God the first
thoughts and the first hours of the day, it is hard, amid
company and business, to serve Him at all.... I will
therefore choose a lodging which is not far either from
God or from the King.”</p>

<p>He thinks it is hardly advisable to make a point of
waiting on the King every day. That is all very well for
courtiers who have nothing else to do.</p>

<p>“... But in the first days after my arrival at Court, I
shall present myself every day until he has been pleased to
speak or to listen to me ... after which it will be enough
to appear in Paris once a week and at Fontainebleau every
third day.... If one presents one’s self merely to see the
King, one must stand within sight when he is at table; if
to speak to him, one must draw near to his chair. Take
care to stay discourse when the King drinks.</p>

<p>“The words most agreeable to the King are those which
exalt his royal virtues. He likes keen points and sudden
repartees. He prefers those who speak boldly—but with
respect. It is well to fall back constantly on the cadence
that by ill luck one has been able to do him service only
in small matters, and that there is nothing too great or
impossible to be done, with good will, for so good a master
and so great a king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>“It is important to notice which way the wind blows,
and not to take him in a humour when he cares to speak to
no one and kicks against everybody.</p>

<p>“As to other great men, one must visit them ...
remembering that sacrifices are paid both to the harmful
and the favourable gods.... The best time is the morning,
in order to accompany them when they go out, and I think
this the most honourable. Some choose the time when
they return for dinner, and run the risk of being sent off
without a word.”</p>

<p>He speaks scornfully of the “strange servitude” endured
by those who “follow tables” day by day, wasting hours
in search of a dinner.</p>

<p>“... At table, if one must talk, one should take care
that the discourse is of indifferent matters; history;
descriptions of countries; towns; powerful families; laws
and customs. Questions of State, commerce, astrology,
fortification, music and other science ... without pedantry,
and without showing too curiously what one knows.</p>

<p>“And because in these conversations one learns more
than by reading the best books ... they should be carefully
noted down in a book, of which every page should be
marked with some significant word or name.”</p>

<p>M. Baschet, and other students of Richelieu’s manuscripts,
have noticed how curiously these words foreshadow
the habit of his whole life—to write everything down,
“maxims, reflexions, facts,” for correct remembrance and
future use.</p>

<p>He dwells much on the need of discretion in dealing
with the great, their sayings and doings, and on the serious
peril that lies in pleading for one’s friends, so often malcontent
and unreasonable. But he will not, he says, follow
in the path of those who promise and do not perform.</p>

<p>As to more personal caution: “Turn away the ear from
those who would tell of other people’s business, and never
repeat what they say, still less what they do.”</p>

<p>This was hardly the favourite maxim in after life of
the man who employed more spies than any one else in
history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>Letters to friends he finds perilous, having had experience
of the same.</p>

<p>“In letters written to friends one must take care that
there is nothing to injure either him who writes or him
who receives, for these are occasions much spied upon
and desired by enemies, and which bring about repentance
and confusion. As to that, I remember what I wrote on
the execution of the Maréchal de Biron, whereof the King
spoke to me, and after His Majesty Monsieur de Villeroy....</p>

<p>“In letters of compliment which may be shown, I shall
write no new thing and no opinion except as to common
things which may be published without peril.... I shall
keep a copy of important letters.... Writing to the same
person several letters in one packet, I shall mark by number
those first to be read.... I shall reply to all those who
write to me, and shall forget nothing which should be
considered either in their quality or their discourse. No
one, not even a Knight of the Order, should be dispensed
from answering a letter from one greatly his inferior....
One should read letters more than once before answering
them.... Letters of importance, carefully kept, serve
more purposes than one thinks when one receives them....
The fire should keep those which the casket cannot
keep with safety.... I shall carefully cultivate the
acquaintance and friendship of one or two Commissioners
of the Post, in order that letters may be more faithfully
delivered and forwarded with care and diligence....”</p>

<p>So much for correspondence. The later notes deal with
a courtier’s most difficult study, dissimulation, and here,
as elsewhere, it strikes one how large a part of Richelieu’s
commanding genius lay in “an infinite capacity for taking
pains.” His advice to himself is mostly—“Silence.”</p>

<p>“Not to publish abroad what has been said in confidence:
Not to divulge any affair that may cause scandal:
Not to discover one’s own plans, which being discovered
may fail: Not to show that we are aware of the faults and
the bad actions of others, because men with these faults
hate those who know them: Not to show that we perceive
the ill-will men bear to ourselves or to those whom we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
love: Not to show that we know any harm men have
done us, or that we feel ourselves offended: Not to run
any risk of brawls and quarrels.... To all these ends,
silence is necessary and is not reprehensible. And though
it may be very hard to live with one’s friends in this manner
and to be silent as to their affairs, nevertheless reason
teaches us to fix our eyes on what signifies most, and to
do no harm or prejudice to ourselves.”</p>

<p>Here, a thought of sinning against truth and sincerity
seems to have troubled the Bishop a little, for he ends
by trying to explain how a man may with difficulty steer
between two risks, “the reproach of lying and the peril of
truth.” His counsel is, “Make a timely and cautious retreat
without downright falsehood, saying nothing that ought
not to be said.” Finally, “Be very reserved in words
and in writing, and neither say nor write what is not
absolutely necessary.”</p>

<p>Altogether a severe set of rules to be followed by a
fiery, proud and impatient nature.</p>

<p>Imagination, of course, should not be allowed to play
with history: but considering that the exact date of
Richelieu’s “Instructions et Maximes” is not and never
can be known, one may venture to fancy that he laid down
his pen on a certain day in May 1610, just as the post from
Paris had clattered into his courtyard, bringing crushing
news for France and for himself. Henry, “un si bon maître
et si grand Roy,” had been stabbed to death by the fanatic
hand of Ravaillac, leaving his country in the hands of a
weak woman just crowned, a melancholy little boy, and
a group of princes and great nobles, greedy of money
and power.</p>

<p>We have the very letter in which this news came to
Richelieu. His faithful Sébastien Bouthillier was in Paris
at the time, and wrote to him immediately after the tragic
event. He had intended, he said, to send him an account
of the Queen’s coronation; but had been interrupted by
“the most strange and fatal accident.”</p>

<p>“On Friday, the 14th, His Majesty had gone to the
Rue Saint-Denis to see the preparations for the Queen’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
entry, and, returning, was in the street called de la
Ferronnerie, when a wicked man, or rather the most
execrable monster on earth, climbed on the hinder part of
the coach inside which His Majesty was, and, unrestrained
by the respect and fear due to the Lord’s anointed and
the greatest prince in the world, attacking him from behind
whose face brought terror to his enemies and assurance
to all his subjects, gave him two blows with a knife, of
which the first was not mortal, although both went
through the body. When the report ran through Paris
that the King was dead, you cannot imagine, Sir, the
grief of all the people, the amazement of the nobles, every
one sad and cast down; and yet, in the midst of this general
sadness, it was courageously resolved to establish the
Queen as regent, so that, three hours after the catastrophe,
the King having expired, the Court of Parliament
assembled at the Augustins, M. le Prince de Conti, MM. de
Guise, d’Épernon, de Montbazon and many others being
present, and verified the letters patent of the Regency
which the late King had caused to be made out.”</p>

<p>The Abbé goes on to describe the sorrowful and loyal
reception of the young Louis XIII., on Saturday, at the
Palais de Justice, and then adds what he knows will
interest his Bishop more than any other Parisian news
he can send him at the moment.</p>

<p>“I must tell you that M. le Cardinal du Perron shows
on all occasions the esteem in which he holds you; for
I hear that when there was talk a few months ago, in
his presence, of the young prelates of France, and when
some one spoke of you in terms of praise, according to
the reputation you have gained, M. le Cardinal said that
you should not be counted among the young prelates,
that the oldest ought to give way to you, and that for
his own part he was ready to be an example to the rest.
M. de Richelieu, to whom this was said, repeated it to
me in so many words.”</p>

<p>This penetrating Cardinal du Perron, Archbishop of
Sens, was one of the loftiest ecclesiastical figures of the
time. Theologian and politician, he had been Richelieu’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
chief patron in Paris, and his words, as Sébastien
Bouthillier very well knew, were not a mere piece of
flattery addressed to Richelieu’s brother.</p>

<p>Though the terror and excitement in Paris were much
greater than Bouthillier reported, France, as a whole,
seems to have kept its head at this tragical time, the
provinces remaining quiet. This may have been due to
the fact that the news, as it travelled down with rolling
wheels, galloping hoofs, running feet, into the depths of
the country, caused more grief than surprise. It had long
been prophesied that Henry would die a violent death,
and such prophecies, no doubt, sometimes bring their own
fulfilment. For the last four or five years, every natural
marvel or disaster had been counted as an evil omen for
the King. “Heaven and earth,” says Péréfixe, “had given
only too many prognostications of what happened to him.
A very great eclipse of the sun, which came to pass in
the year 1608; a terrible comet, which appeared in the
preceding year; quakings of the earth; monstrous births
in divers parts of France; a rain of blood, which fell in
several places; a great plague, which afflicted Paris in
the year 1606; apparitions of phantoms, and many other
prodigies, held men in dread of some horrible event.”</p>

<p>The King’s death was actually reported in Italy, Spain,
and even Flanders, some time before it took place; written
predictions were found in churches, and bells tolled of
themselves; women, especially nuns, had frightful dreams
and visions of murder; it was even known that Ravaillac,
the melancholy madman of the Angoumois, was consulting
his conscience as to whether a King who contemplated
war with Catholic Spain ought to live or die. This tale
reached the Queen, through an unlucky woman, the Dame
d’Escoman, whose reward for having meddled in the
matter was imprisonment for life. That Marie de Médicis,
supported by her Concini favourites, secretly wished
and plotted for Henry’s death, is probably one of the
most cruel slanders ever invented by the enemies of a
queen.</p>

<p>The prophecies and portents were not unknown to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
the King, and although he was certainly neither timid
nor credulous, they depressed his gay spirit. During those
last months he appeared, says Péréfixe, “as if he were condemned
to death.” A heavy presentiment weighed upon
him. He dreaded the Queen’s coronation—“ce maudit
sacre”—and told Sully that he knew he would die in a
coach. Indeed he, so daring in war, had long been curiously
nervous when driving in the Paris streets; and on the
fatal day, though he wished to visit the Arsenal, where his
friend and Minister lay ill, he doubted and hesitated before
leaving the Louvre. “Shall I go? Shall I not go?” he
said several times to the Queen. Alarmed at his strange
dejection, Marie begged him to stay; but he kissed her
affectionately, bade her adieu, and went straight to his
death in the Rue de la Ferronnerie.</p>

<p>Thus the Bishop of Luçon was deprived of the royal
patron from whom he had hoped so much. But he seems
to have wasted very little time in mourning his own and
the country’s loss. His first thought was to bring himself
before the Queen, to gain a footing in the new Court,
different in many ways from the old. And this did not
appear to be a difficult task for a young and quick-witted
man. The day of old men, old soldiers, old courtiers
and friends of “le Béarnais,” was over.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Luçon had already friends and supporters
in the Regent’s intimate circle. His brother and brother-in-law,
Henry de Richelieu and René de Vignerot, Seigneur
du Pont-de-Courlay, were among her most favoured
courtiers. The Marquise de Guercheville, her lady of
honour, accustomed to courts since the days of Catherine
de Médicis, was a connection on the Du Plessis side; and
two at least of the young maids of honour bore familiar
family names—Pont-de-Courlay, Meilleraye. At this time,
too, the Père de Bérulle, Richelieu’s personal friend, had
great influence with the Queen, and the same might be
said of the Père Cotton, the late King’s confessor. The
Jesuits did not yet regard Richelieu as an enemy.</p>

<p>It was not till after long delays, however, that the
Bishop of Luçon reached the Queen-Regent’s distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
favour and the front of affairs. His first step was a hurried
and an unlucky one. On the 22nd of May he wrote out
a curious document, a kind of oath of allegiance and
declaration of loyalty to the young King and his mother,
from himself as Bishop and Baron, his dean, canons, and
clergy. He sent this paper to his brother in Paris, begging
him to deliver it into the Queen’s own hands. Henry de
Richelieu’s worldly wisdom at once refused this favour.
Such zeal was quite out of place, he said: <i>Cela ne se fait
pas</i>: nobody else in the kingdom had done anything of
the sort, and he, an experienced courtier, would not allow
his forward brother to push himself by such means.
Bouthillier was employed to send this discouraging reply
to the Bishop, whose restless eagerness it hardly served to
check.</p>

<p>It convinced him, indeed, that nothing was to be done
from a distance, and that the best of relations and friends
would not help a man who was not on the spot to help
himself. Early in June we find him writing to Madame
de Bourges about a permanent lodging in Paris. As he
intends to spend some time there every year, he wants
advice as to situation and cost, also as to furniture, tapestry,
plate, wine, etc. Poor as ever in purse, he is no less
determined to make a good show in the capital: “C’est
grande pitié que de pauvre noblesse, mais il n’y a remède:
contre fortune bon cœur.”</p>

<p>He went to Paris, and remained there for some months;
but it was an unhappy and a disappointing visit. During
these early days of her regency, Marie de Médicis had
neither power nor leisure to make new friends. Concini,
Maréchal d’Ancre, and his wife Leonora, reigned at the
Louvre, though hardly yet outside it. The peace of the
kingdom, according to Richelieu’s own <i>Memoirs</i>, depended
on the princes—Condé, Soissons, d’Épernon, Guise, and
their like. In these first months they kept it unbroken,
and all, Parliament, nobles, statesmen, churchmen, municipalities,
governors of provinces, were ready “to serve the
King under the guidance of the Queen.” The Huguenots
were pacified, for the moment, by the renewal of the Edict<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
of Nantes. But the “grands de la cour” did not give their
allegiance for nothing. Henry’s old Ministers, holding on
to power with many searchings of heart, were forced to
consent to the enormous bribes demanded by everybody.
These “gratifications extraordinaires” were scattered with
open hand among greedy nobles and courtiers, and, added
to the Queen’s own personal extravagance, were likely
soon to empty Henry’s precious coffers, so painfully filled.
As to the Duc de Sully, whose rough temper, bad manners
and comparative honesty had long made him unpopular
at Court, a conspiracy among the nobles forced on his
retirement in the winter of 1610. All these warring
interests and anxieties, with visits from special foreign
embassies, with the young King’s coronation at Rheims,
with the question of war or peace beyond the frontiers,
made a social whirlpool of Paris and the Court.</p>

<p>The young provincial Bishop, without money or claims,
whose few personal friends were naturally more interested
in their own affairs than in his, found himself left behind
in the race for power and fortune. His old enemy, fever,
seized on him again and laid him low: Paris proved more
unhealthy than even the marshes of Luçon. Terribly
depressed by illness, he was irritated and annoyed by
letters from his Cathedral chapter, complaining of disorders
in the diocese, and he wrote sharply in answer, following
his letters early in the year 1611. There was no advantage
to be gained by staying in Paris, neglected and obscure.</p>

<p>Through all the first half of this year, Richelieu was
in a Slough of Despond both mental and physical, brooding
over difficulties and disappointments, and constantly ill
with fever. It seems that in these dark days Père Joseph
was his good angel.</p>

<p>The clever Capuchin had a troublesome affair on hand:
the management of a woman who, though “illustre
religieuse et grande servante de Dieu,” was resolved to
follow her own way and not that which director, Pope
and King had marked out for her. Père Joseph was a
crusader by nature, and a reformer to the backbone, with
a fiery obstinacy and positive, autocratic will. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
already reformed several convents in Poitou, in which the
civil war, the invasion of an outside world, had strangely
travestied the religious life. Some of these convents
belonged to the great Benedictine Order of Fontevrault;
and even in the Mother House itself, under the gentle and
charitable guidance of Madame Eléonore de Bourbon, the
strictness of the old Rule was half forgotten.</p>

<p>Madame Antoinette d’Orléans, of the Longueville
family, the young widow of the Marquis de Belle-Isle,
had become a nun at Toulouse, at a convent of the
Feuillantines, and asked nothing better than to spend
her remaining days there. But she was known to Père
Joseph as a woman like-minded with himself, an enthusiast
and a saint; and when, in 1604, a bull of Pope Paul V.
appointed her Coadjutrix of her aunt the Abbess of
Fontevrault, the young reformer welcomed her as an
ally in his work. And as far as outside convents were
concerned, she did not disappoint him. But though she
loyally helped and supported the old Abbess in the government
of the Order, her heart was never at Fontevrault.
Her religious ideals were totally different from those of
the two hundred or more Sisters who marched with such
stately dignity through the venerable cloisters and took
their high place in the choir where Plantagenets slept.
Their rich possessions, their amusements—innocent enough,
for Fontevrault, owing to the character of its long and
regal line of abbesses, was never seriously touched by
scandal; their little parties and cabals and gossip—good
women, simple in faith and practice, but not lofty-minded
or mystical: all this fell far below the standard of Madame
d’Orléans, and her one desire was to escape from her
dignity, to return to her “dear solitude.” As she had
never formally accepted the office of Coadjutrix, with the
prospect of succession, this did not seem impossible.</p>

<p>The difficulty was that Père Joseph would not let
her go. In her authority and influence he saw the only
means by which the reform of the great Abbey might be
carried through. There were divisions in the community;
some of the nuns being ready to welcome a change, others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
strongly opposed to it. Père Joseph and Madame de
Bourbon both saw that no unanimity was to be hoped
for, as long as the future was known to be uncertain.</p>

<p>Père Joseph took the matter into his own hands, and
settled it by a <i>coup d’état</i>, secret and sudden. After a
private consultation with the King in Council, he wrote
to the Pope; and Paul V., convinced by his arguments,
commanded Madame d’Orléans, under pain of excommunication,
to accept her office immediately with all the duties
it involved, and to assume the government of the Order,
with the certainty of succeeding her aunt as Abbess of
Fontevrault.</p>

<p>The command fell on Madame d’Orléans like a thunder-bolt,
but she could only obey. The consequence was what
Père Joseph had desired and foreseen. The new ruler,
once forced to rule, advanced “à pas de géant” in the
appointed way. In one short week Fontevrault was
reformed; every one of the nuns accepting the inevitable,
all giving up their worldly indulgences, and returning to
the old strict regulation of work and prayer.</p>

<p>This happy state of things went on for two years, and
Père Joseph, seeing his reformation well at work, was
occupied with his other duties as a director of souls—especially
of that of the Duchesse de Montpensier, living
retired at Champigny and mourning both her husband
and her father, the Capuchin Duc de Joyeuse, who did
not long survive his son-in-law—when Madame d’Orléans
played him the same trick he had played her. She wrote
secretly to the Pope, imploring him to have compassion
on her trouble of mind, explaining how seriously her
“tumultuous occupations” interfered with her personal
sanctification, and praying him to withdraw his command
that she should succeed Madame de Bourbon and to
allow her, on her aunt’s death, to return to her beloved
Feuillantines of Toulouse. She begged His Holiness to
inquire into the matter through commissaries of his own,
without consulting Père Joseph. The Pope did as she
wished, and she received full liberty to go where she
pleased. Then she sent for Père Joseph and told him all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
on condition that nothing should be said to Madame de
Bourbon. The old Abbess was to die in peace, imagining
that her Coadjutrix would succeed her.</p>

<p>Père Joseph needed all his prudence and self-control,
says his biographer, to hide his vexation at being thus
“joué par une Princesse.”</p>

<p>But the thing was done, and he made the best of it,
secretly hoping that, “women being naturally inconstant,”
the joy of supreme authority might yet induce Madame
d’Orléans to change her mind.</p>

<p>On March 26, 1611, at the age of seventy-eight, Madame
Eléonore de Bourbon died. To all appearance, her Coadjutrix
was ready to accept the succession. She even seemed
to listen with favour to the persuasions of Père Joseph, who
pointed out in glowing terms her duty to the Order. It
was near the end of Lent, and Madame d’Orléans held
her peace until after the Festival of Easter. On Low
Sunday, having assembled the Community, she announced
to them that she was about to write to the King and
the Queen Regent, praying them to nominate an abbess
in her stead.</p>

<p>This was a heavy blow to Père Joseph, and the affair
was complicated by his knowledge of the fact that Madame
d’Orléans did not now wish to return to Toulouse, but
dreamed of founding a new convent in the province of
Poitou, where the religious life, as she understood it, would
be lived in all devotion and austerity.</p>

<p>Père Joseph, who with all his cleverness and strength
had an attractive modesty, felt himself unequal to dealing
alone with this reverend lady, and with the discord and
confusion she had caused at Fontevrault. This, at least,
was the reason he gave for his appeal to the Bishop of
Luçon, “whose superior and transcendent genius had
enchanted him,” and who happened to be residing very
near Fontevrault, at his Priory of Les Roches.</p>

<p>The Abbey of Fontevrault was quite independent of
episcopal authority, and it was only as representing the
Pope or the King that any bishop had the right to enter
it. Père Joseph appealed to Richelieu as a friend; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
judging from his lifelong devotion, it may be imagined
that he joyfully seized this opportunity of rousing the
Bishop from the state of fever-stricken depression in which
he had returned from Paris. Here, if ever, was a case of
a man’s “sharpening the countenance of his friend.” The
dying flame was blown into life; hope took suddenly
the place of something very like despair. The Capuchin
discussed his difficulties with the Bishop, and they agreed
that the whole question must be laid before the Queen
Regent. Therefore they travelled together to Fontainebleau,
where the Court was staying, amid all the enchantment
of its exquisite spring.</p>

<p>Marie de Médicis, at this time, was far from happy. A
year had passed since Henry’s death; and to a woman
both lazy and power-loving, the quarrels, ambitions,
jealousies, of the princes and courtiers, each day harder
to satisfy, were a constant torment; matters not being
improved by the insolent pride of Concini, who posed as
the equal of them all. The envoys from Poitou, asking
nothing for themselves—no one dreamed that these two
men, one ugly, grave, humble in appearance, the other
delicate, worn, exhausted, would one day rule France and
influence Europe—were graciously received by the Queen;
and it appears that Père Joseph, in a few moments of
private conversation after the Fontevrault business had
been explained, spoke to her of his companion in terms
of enthusiastic praise, as “a man of sublime genius and
extraordinary merit, capable of the highest employments.”
The words remained in the Queen’s mind and bore fruit,
though not immediately.</p>

<p>The Bishop and the friar returned to Fontevrault,
bearing the royal permission for the community to choose
an abbess among themselves; but in the presence and
with the consent of the Bishop of Luçon and Père Joseph.
The solemn election took place in the summer, when the
Grand Prioress, Madame Louise de Lavedan de Bourbon,
was naturally chosen.</p>

<p>Madame Antoinette d’Orléans retired to Lencloître, a
half-ruined convent of the Order near Poitiers, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
there joined by many nuns from all parts of France, and
even from Fontevrault itself, who desired to lead a stricter
life under her guidance. It was not long before she founded,
with the help and approval of Père Joseph and the Bishops
of Luçon and Poitiers, a congregation known as <i>Les Filles
du Calvaire</i>, independent of Fontevrault, the object of which
was the practice of the Rule of St. Benedict in all its
austere purity.</p>

<p>Pushed constantly to the front by Père Joseph, and
with no unwillingness on his own part, the Bishop of
Luçon added much to his reputation by his conduct of
these affairs; State affairs, they might almost be called,
considering the rank of those concerned and the wealth
and political importance of the great Order of Fontevrault.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Waiting for an opportunity—Political unrest—The States-General
of 1614—The Bishop of Luçon speaks.</p>
</div>

<p>Richelieu worked hard in his diocese for the next
three years, struggling all the while with ill-health
and impatience. He went to Paris once during
this time and offered his services to the powerful Concini,
who received him graciously; but nothing more came
of it. And the Queen was for the present inaccessible.
Another disappointment was his failure to be elected as
representative of his ecclesiastical province, Bordeaux,
at a convocation of the clergy which was held in Paris in
the early days of the Regency. On this occasion the
Archbishop of Bordeaux, Cardinal de Sourdis—nicknamed
<i>Sordido</i>—showed himself an enemy to the aspiring young
man.</p>

<p>But no envious Metropolitan could keep Richelieu long
in the background. He was becoming a very popular
figure in the west country, of which Poitou and its learned
capital were the centre. His private life appears to have
been blameless. He kept up an affectionate intercourse
with his own family. For his mother he was still “mon
malade,” from childhood a sickly, brilliant creature, a
subject of uneasiness and pride. His sister, Madame du
Pont-de-Courlay, turned to him for sympathy in a money
loss or the death of a little child. He never lost sight of
his brother Alphonse, the Carthusian, whose refusal had
made him a bishop, and whom, in later years of power,
he dragged from his cloister to be Archbishop and Cardinal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>He was a favourite with most of his neighbours,
clerical and lay. His correspondence bears witness to
the wideness of his acquaintance and interests, both
public and private; people appealed to him as a friend,
an arbitrator, and he never disappointed them. He was
courteous, kind, even tender in his language: “episcopal
and benign.” He was on the politest terms with such
of the great men as occasionally crossed his path: the
Duc de Sully, governor of Poitou, now no longer a
courtier and an absentee; the Duc de Villeroy, still in
office, father of his friend M. d’Alincourt, and others of
high rank and importance. His letters to such men as
these, as well as to his more intimate friends, might have
foreshadowed his coming greatness for those who had
eyes to see. To the general company, however, the writer
whose well-turned assurances and compliments had such
a background of passionate ambition for his own and for
his country’s glory, was nothing but a clever phrase-maker,
a young man of seven-and-twenty who could
talk and argue, convert a few Protestants, deal discreetly
with the wrangles of religious women. And outside
a limited circle the name of Richelieu was probably
unknown, except as that of a pensioned courtier of the
Regency.</p>

<p>While the Bishop of Luçon waited for his opportunity,
political and religious unrest was deepening in France.
Henry IV.’s policy of opposition to the House of Austria
and alliance with Savoy, Holland, and the German
Protestants, had been set aside very early in the new
reign, and two royal marriages were arranged to bind
France closer to the Holy See and Catholic Europe.
Louis XIII. was to be married to the Infanta Anna of
Spain—known to history as Anne of Austria—and his
eldest sister, Élisabeth, to the Infant of Spain, afterwards
Philip IV. These marriages seem to have pleased nobody
in France except the Regent, her immediate Court circle
and her Ministers, whose only hope of keeping their place
lay in her favour. The Foreign Secretary, Villeroy, the
Chancellor, Brûlart de Sillery, the Connétable de Montmorency,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
were among the Queen’s advisers in this affair.
Most of the nobles, and especially the princes, were more
or less in opposition; the strengthening of the Crown by
so close an alliance with Spain did not suit their interests.
Henry IV. himself, when the project was first laid before
him by the Spanish Ambassador in 1610, had not listened
encouragingly.</p>

<p>The Huguenot party was both displeased and alarmed.
Assemblies were held at Nîmes, at Saumur, at La Rochelle;
but the leaders, such as the Ducs de Bouillon and de
Rohan—Sully’s son-in-law—were not ready to proceed to
civil war. Condé, at first throwing in his lot with them,
soon went farther. He gathered troops in the west and
threatened Poitiers, after publishing, with the other princes,
a fierce manifesto against the Regent and her advisers.
The young Bishop of Poitiers, Richelieu’s friend, took
matters with a high hand, closed the gates in the Queen’s
name, and prepared to defend the town against Condé,
with the high approval of the future Abbé de St Cyran,
a worthy member, like himself, of the Church Militant.
The Prince’s bands overran Poitou, annoying the peaceable
inhabitants, Madame de Richelieu among them, exacting
large sums and quartering themselves in the villages.</p>

<p>In a fiery letter to M. de Neufbourg, an officer of
Condé’s ally, the Duc de Mayenne, the Bishop of Luçon
expresses his amazement that his mother has been thought
worthy of so little courtesy. “Be good enough,” he says,
“to exempt the parish of Saulnes, which belongs to
Madame de Richelieu, from the lodging of troops and the
contributions they demand. I would have written direct
to him (M. de Mayenne) had not his treatment of my
mother made me aware that he either believes me to be
no longer of this world or that he deems me now and
for ever incapable of doing him any service. Therefore
I address myself to you....”</p>

<p>Like his episcopal brother of Poitiers, Richelieu took
his stand openly on the side of Royalty and against the
horde of greedy nobles who caught at any pretext to add
to their own possessions and power. It was not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
the political necessities of his later life that made him
their enemy.</p>

<p>The flame of civil war soon died down. In May 1614
the Queen signed the treaty of St. Menehould, which
pacified the princes, after some delay, by granting most
of their desires. Condé, Nevers, Vendôme, Mayenne,
Longueville, Bouillon and others received enormous
pensions, as well as fortresses and governments; last, not
least, the States-General were summoned, as the manifesto
had demanded, to discuss the grievances of the three
estates of the realm. The Huguenot party had already
obtained some satisfaction. For the time, the Regent and
her ministers had bought victory: the arrangements for
the Spanish marriages went steadily on.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Luçon was directed by Sully, governor
of Poitou, to supervise “with gentleness” the election in
his diocese of deputies for the States-General. He did his
duty, no doubt, in the matter; but the election that
interested him was that of the diocese of Poitiers. There
his friends were working for him. La Rocheposay, the
warlike Bishop, his lieutenant Saint-Cyran, and Richelieu’s
faithful Bouthillier, smoothed the way for his uncontested
election as one of the two deputies of the clergy of
Poitiers. The old city, so lately in a stage of siege,
rang joy-bells on August 10, the appointed day. All over
Poitou, all over France, the bells were ringing, for every
estate in the kingdom hoped much from the States-General.
It may at once be said that rich and poor, great and
small, were disappointed. What the bells rang in was
not liberty, release from taxes, confirmation of rights, but
the reign of Richelieu. And in consequence of that reign
the voice of France in her States-General was not heard
again for one hundred and seventy-five years—not until,
in 1789, “the whirligig of Time brought in his revenges.”</p>

<p>The States-General of 1614 were formally opened in
Paris on Monday, October 27. On Sunday took place
the customary procession from the great Convent of the
Augustins on the left bank, along the quay, winding
through narrow streets crowded with spectators and hung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
with tapestry, to the bridge over the Seine which led
most directly to the Cathedral of Notre Dame, where a
solemn high mass was to be celebrated. It was a procession
gay with colour and variety, although most of
the clergy and all the Third Estate were in sober black.
But the way was kept throughout by the royal guards,
Swiss and French, in their varied liveries. Archers
marched alongside, bearing immense tapers, faint flames
quivering in the chilly air of the early autumn morning.
Many of the deputies shivered, and complained of the
cold.</p>

<p>It was a representative procession. The religious
Orders, parish clergy, and trade corporations of Paris,
the canons of Notre Dame, the doctors of the University—these
led the way. Then came the hundred and ninety-two
deputies of the <i>Tiers État</i>, walking four by four, with
their distinguished President, Robert Miron, provost of
the merchants. Then a hundred and thirty-two nobles
in Court dress with swords. Then the clerical deputies,
a hundred and forty, followed by the bishops and archbishops
in purple and the cardinals in red. Then the
Archbishop of Paris, bearing the sacred Host under a
gorgeous canopy. Then the boy-King, walking in white,
his mother in deep black, her young children, her attendant
ladies and gentlemen; Queen Marguerite de Valois, the
“aunt” of the Royal Family, and various other great
ladies, princes, and nobles attached to the Court. After
these followed the whole Parliament and the Municipality
of Paris, with many officials and guards.</p>

<p>Like a wave of noise, colour and light, with its tramping
feet and flickering candles, under the heavy clangour
of the great bells, the procession rolls into Notre Dame,
and the Cardinal-Archbishop of Bordeaux, Richelieu’s hated
Metropolitan, thunders out his sermon to the Estates of
France: “Fear God. Honour the King.”</p>

<p>The three Estates held their sittings in three of the
vast rooms of the Convent of the Augustins, but the
opening ceremony took place in the hall of the old Hôtel
de Bourbon, east of the Louvre. There the little King, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
dark, solemn boy, whose majority, on entering his fourteenth
year, had lately been celebrated, sat enthroned “on violet
velvet, powdered with golden lilies.” On his right were
the two Queens, Marie and Marguerite, and the young
Princess Élisabeth, the future Queen of Spain. His brother
Gaston, a lively, pretty child of five, his little sisters
Christine and Henriette Marie, sat on his left; a gorgeous
ring of princes, courtiers and great ladies surrounded them.
In theory, the body of the hall was kept for deputies;
in fact, it was inconveniently crowded by Parisians, chiefly
hangers-on of the Court. “Tout était plein de dames et
de damoiselles, de gentilshommes et autre peuple,” says
Florimond Rapine, the chronicler. The deputies were
indignant, and it was long before all could find places.
Then the wild, ill-assorted assembly listened kindly to a
few stammering words from Louis XIII., and impatiently to
a long harangue from Chancellor Sillery, which committed
the Government to nothing.</p>

<p>The ceremonies of opening and closing were very much
the same. Three months of arguing and quarrelling, during
which Paris was frequently in an uproar, the Prince de
Condé claiming homage that nobody would pay, the
Duc d’Épernon insulting the Parliament, gentlemen fighting
in the streets, the Estates themselves divided into
violent parties for and against the Pope and Spain, the
Third Estate demanding the abolition of pensions and
privileges, the nobles and clergy angrily defending their
rights, brought the assembly once more together at the
Hôtel de Bourbon, in the presence of the Court.</p>

<p>Manners had not improved. Two thousand of the
baser sort of courtiers, men and women, with numbers
of people of all kinds, had crowded into the best places.
Rapine saw “cardinals, bishops, priors, abbots, the
nobility and all the Third Estate, crowded and pushed
without order, respect, or consideration, among the pikemen
and halberdiers.”</p>

</figure>

<p>In the midst of this babel, the spokesmen of the three
Orders had to present to the King their <i>cahiers</i>, containing
the result of their stormy deliberations. First it was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
turn of the clergy; and their orator, chosen, like his fellows,
by the influence of the Queen-Regent, was the Bishop of
Luçon.</p>

<p>He had already gained much credit, during the debates
of the last three months, for eloquence and judgment;
he was one of the group of young and brilliant bishops
who supported Cardinal du Perron, always his friend,
in his efforts to bring the <i>Tiers État</i> into harmony with
the views of the clergy. The burning question was an
article resolved on by the <i>Tiers</i>, demanding that the King’s
complete independence of every power, spiritual or
temporal, except God alone, should be made “a fundamental
law of the State.” It was the old Gallican, anti-Roman
doctrine, which, as far as the middle classes of
France were concerned, had been growing in strength
for some years. It had fought the League; it opposed
the Jesuits; it defied the authority of the Pope. It rose
up in anger against the courtly politicians who now, with
their Spanish alliances, were contradicting and nullifying
the policy of Henry IV.</p>

<p>There were Gallicans among the clergy, but the majority
were Ultramontane, equally loyal to the Pope and to the
Queen-Regent’s government. Cardinal du Perron and
his distinguished phalanx wasted hours of eloquence—and
the Cardinal was both a great orator and an attractive
man—in persuading the <i>Tiers</i> to withdraw their obnoxious
article. Matters were made worse by the Parliament of
Paris, Gallican and anti-Spanish to the core, which openly
supported the <i>Tiers</i>, as also did Condé and his followers
and the Huguenot party under Bouillon.</p>

<p>Forty years later, Louis XIV.’s whip was to teach both
nobles and Parliament the meaning of that divine right
and absolute power which they were now eager to claim
for their kings. On this occasion the article was referred
to Louis XIII., and by his authority was expunged from
the <i>cahier</i> of the <i>Tiers État</i>.</p>

<p>It was in a spirit of triumphant loyalty, therefore, both
to his Order and to the King—or rather, to the Queen and
her councillors—that Armand de Richelieu made the oration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
which gained him his first real fame. He stood before the
whole of France—all France that signified, for even the
humble millions were represented, though mostly by men
of law—slight and delicate, with a pleasant voice, an easy,
graceful manner, eyes bright and clear, yet thoughtful, a
mouth both strong and smiling under the thin moustache
brushed sharply upwards, which always gave him the look
of a soldier.</p>

<p>His discourse lasted an hour, and gave great satisfaction
to all his hearers, who were struck by the discretion with
which he touched on many difficult subjects “without
offending anybody.” It was indeed a delicate task, to
complain of the treatment bestowed on the Church and
her clergy by the chief authorities in the kingdom; to
praise the clergy, their learning, probity and self-denial,
and to claim for them a larger share in the management
of State affairs; to point out the many abuses of lay
patronage; to condemn the excesses of some Huguenots
while declaring that no weapons but example, instruction
and prayer should be used against those who, “if blinded
by error,” yet lived peaceably under the royal authority;
to remonstrate against unfair taxation, corruption and
bribery in high places; to demand the reduction of pensions
and the abolition of duels, according to the laws
of “the great Henry”:—and in the same breath to praise
the Queen-Regent for the great things she had already
done in preserving “peace, repose and public tranquillity,”
chief of which was that “sacred bond of a double marriage”
which was soon to unite “the greatest kingdoms of the
world.” In short, while performing the full duty prescribed
by his Order, to make himself <i>persona grata</i> to
Marie de Médicis, was a task worthy of Armand de
Richelieu.</p>

<p>The Baron de Sénecé, spokesman of the nobles, followed
the Bishop of Luçon, but had little to say. On the other
hand Robert Miron, who spoke—on his knees—for the
<i>Tiers État</i>, had a great deal. He drew a frightful picture
of the “wounds and sorrows” of the poor people of
France, their constant labour and heavy burdens. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
complained bitterly of the abuses in the Church, the
privileges, oppressions, public and private violence of the
nobles, the delays and the corruption of justice, the ravages
of armed men.</p>

<p>“Without the labour of the poor people,” he cried,
“where were the tithes of the Church—the vast possessions
of the nobility, their wide lands, their great fiefs—the
houses, the incomes, the heritages of the Third Estate?
And further, who gives your Majesty the means of keeping
up the royal dignity, of providing for the necessary
expenses of the State, within and without the kingdom?
who gives the means of raising men for the wars, if not
the labourer and the taxes he pays?” And he added those
remarkable words: “It is to be feared that despair may
teach the poor people that the soldier is but a peasant
bearing arms, and that when the vinedresser takes up an
arquebus, he may become hammer instead of anvil.”</p>

<p>But Miron, like the other speakers, professed devoted
loyalty to the King, only begging that the royal authority
might interfere to protect the poor people. And Miron’s
harangue, like the others, had no real consequence whatever.
Richelieu observes in his <i>Memoirs</i> that the States-General
ended without advantage to anybody.</p>

<p>The deputies were dismissed, contumelious and discontented,
and returned to the provinces freshly burdened
by their expenses.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Luçon went back to his diocese; but
his speech was printed by the famous Cramoisy. The
Court consoled itself for a very tiresome winter by one of
the most magnificent Mid-Lent ballets that Paris had ever
seen.</p>

Parliament and the Princes—The Royal progress to the South—Treaty of

</div>
<p>In the autumn of the year 1615 Richelieu was appointed
chaplain to the new young Queen of France, Anne
of Austria. He owed this appointment partly to
the impression made by his good looks and talent on
Marie de Médicis, partly to the friendly intrigues of the
Bishop of Bayonne—afterwards Archbishop of Tours, and
an adorer of the beautiful Duchesse de Chevreuse. Owing
to the troubled state of France and the long delay of the
royal entry into Paris, he did not enter upon his duties
till the late spring of 1616.</p>

<p>The easy triumph of the Court party over the rebel
elements in the nation had not lasted long. When the
Parliament of Paris saw that the States-General and all
their talk had ended in nothing—no reform of abuses, no
strengthening of the law, while Concini, the foreign
favourite, now a Marshal of France and Lieutenant-General
of Picardy, was fast becoming the most powerful person
in the kingdom—it raised its voice in angry remonstrance.
And the men of law did not stand alone. “Derrière le
parlement,” says M. Henri Martin, “il y avait les princes,
et à côté des princes, les huguenots.” In fact, a strong
party was making a new and final struggle against the
Spanish marriages. The voice of the English ambassador,
Sir Thomas Edmunds, chimed in with those of Condé,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
Bouillon and the Parliament, begging at least for delay:
in the present state of Europe, James I. found these
marriages “inopportune.” His eldest daughter, Elizabeth,
had lately married the Protestant Elector Palatine, nephew
of the Duc de Bouillon and brought up by him. England
was thus strongly linked with the Protestant cause, both
in France and Germany.</p>

<p>But neither foreign opinion, Parliament, princes, nor
cowardly counsels in her own household—for her favourite
Leonora, Concini’s wife, was against her in this matter—could
turn Marie de Médicis from her intention. The
King and the Ministers, under her orders, haughtily denied
that the Parliament had any right to interfere in affairs
of State. She tried, but in vain, to win over Condé and
his friends. When her failure was plain—Condé retiring
into the country, publishing a manifesto which demanded
the delay of the marriages and the disgrace of Concini and
the old Ministers, and following up his words by raising
an armed force—she replied by arresting his friend Nicolas
Le Jay, a president of the Parliament and leader of the
opposition there. The guards seized him at five o’clock in
the morning of August 17 and hurried him into a coach.
On that same morning the whole Court, conducted by
the Ducs de Guise and d’Épernon with a strong body of
troops, set out on the long journey to the south. President
Le Jay, sorely against his will, followed the King as far
as Amboise, where he was left behind as a prisoner.</p>

<p>Concini—formerly Marquis, now also Maréchal d’Ancre—remained
to oppose the princes in Picardy, of which the
young Duc de Longueville was governor. The Maréchal
de Bois-Dauphin (Montmorency-Laval, Marquis de Sablé)
was left with a royal army of 12,000 men to protect
and overawe Paris, already commanded by the guns of
the Château de Vincennes, and to keep a check on the
Prince de Condé.</p>

<p>The royal progress to the south was slow and
dangerous, with many delays and annoyances. Travelling
was not easy even in summer weather. The long train
of coaches, baggage-waggons and pack-mules, horsemen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
running footmen, with the large military escort, took three
days to travel the good road between Paris and Orléans,
and then for some unknown reason, perhaps the uncertainty
of Condé’s movements, did not arrive at Tours for ten
days more. Here the Court was met by three deputies
from the Huguenot assembly at Grenoble, who had just
missed His Majesty at Paris, and who, “with more
insolence than formerly,” says Richelieu, pressed again
upon him the demands of the <i>Tiers État</i> and requested
him to proceed no further on his journey, “in which they
were interested, not only as being of <i>la Religion prétendue
réformée</i>, but as good Frenchmen.”</p>

<p>In consequence of this and other disloyal proceedings,
the King publicly declared the Prince de Condé and all
his adherents guilty of high treason unless they laid down
their arms within a month, and sent his declaration to
be registered by the Parliament of Paris.</p>

<p>The Court arrived at Poitiers on September 4, and
was detained there, to the Queen-mother’s great vexation,
till the 27th. The little Madame of thirteen, on her way
to be married to the Prince of Spain, had an attack of
small-pox, and Marie herself suffered from an inflamed
arm. As Condé was already fighting his way across
country with the object of blocking the road to Spain,
while the Duc de Rohan, with a small Huguenot army,
was preparing to second him by occupying Guienne and
the Bordelais, it appeared at one moment as if the royal
marriages might be effectually stopped.</p>

<p>Two persons profited by the delay. One was the
Maréchale d’Ancre. That mysterious Leonora, accused,
probably falsely, of witchcraft and so many other crimes,
seized this opportunity to creep back into the favour of
her royal mistress and foster-sister, whom she, in concert
with the Minister Villeroy and others, had seriously
annoyed by advising her against pressing on the marriages.
By devoted nursing of the royal invalids, and by the help
of her Jewish doctor, Montalto, Leonora soon regained
Marie’s selfish affection, to lose it once more, and finally,
before the end of her tragic life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>The other person who profited by the royal visit to
Poitiers was the Bishop of Luçon. On returning from
Paris in the spring, feverish and irritable, he had plunged
deep in theological studies at his favourite Coussay. It
seems to have been a grievance that even his friends
should disturb him at his books. But when the Court
arrived at Poitiers and was detained there, all loyal
persons of any distinction in the province were bound
to wait upon their Majesties. The Bishop of Luçon was
among the foremost in paying his duty. Certain vague
talk of the chaplaincy to Queen Anne now took solid
shape, and he received the promise of his appointment,
which was definitely made in November, when the Court
was at Bordeaux. During the interval, it is evident that
Richelieu considered himself bound to the Queen-mother’s
service. He made it his business to send a report of the
health of Madame, who was left behind at Poitiers for
a few days when the Court hurried forward; and his
letters to Marie de Médicis are full of grateful devotion.</p>

<p>The little French princess was conveyed to the Spanish
frontier, and the little Spanish princess was received in
exchange. Under the escort of the Duc de Guise and six
thousand men—for the Huguenots, under Rohan, made
the journey perilous—she was brought to Bordeaux, where
the King and his mother awaited her. There the marriage
was finally blessed—it had already, in the case of both
princesses, been celebrated by proxy—and there the Court
lingered on till the middle of December, when it began its
slow northward journey, not reaching Tours till January 25,
1616.</p>

<p>The country through which the Court travelled was
in a terrible state, trampled and devastated by armies—“chose
pitoyable et horrible,” says Pontchartrain. In spite
of the Maréchal de Bois-Dauphin, Condé had crossed the
Loire at Neuvy and was storming westward through
Berry, Touraine and Poitou, “pillant et saccageant,” says
Richelieu, “tous les lieux où il passoit.” Again Madame
de Richelieu had her share in the sufferings of the poor
province, which seemed to her even worse off than in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
the Wars of the League. Forty years she had lived at
Richelieu, and never had she seen such men or such
ravages. “If these armies believe in God,” she said, “it
is as the devils do.” The army of Bois-Dauphin was also
marching south-westward, to protect the progress of the
Court. Friend or foe, royalist or rebel, it made no
difference in the wholesale robbery and cruelty which
desolated the villages, utterly destroying any lingering
peaceful fruit of Henry’s administration. Even Sully had
now taken sides with Condé; and the Ducs de Soubise
and de la Trémoïlle had raised a fresh army of Huguenots
in Poitou. The wintry weather made everything worse.
If the armies caused the wretched peasants to suffer, they
suffered themselves. An icy rain was followed by hard
frosts, snow, and “a great furious wind”; thousands of
men, on both sides, died of the wet and the bitter cold. In
Paris, boats and bridges were wrecked by the masses of
broken ice in the Seine.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Luçon, writing strong remonstrances on
his mother’s and his own behalf to the commanders, was
also painfully interested in the negotiations which began
after the Court had reached Verteuil. He would have
been glad to be actively employed, but his time was not
quite come, and he could only look on, trusting to his
friends—especially Claude Barbin, an old acquaintance, the
trusted financial secretary of Marie de Médicis—to push his
name and fortunes.</p>

<p>Both parties were tired of the struggle. The Court did
not wish for eternal war: the princes and their followers
saw that, the Spanish marriages once carried through,
their wisest line of action was to make a good bargain
for themselves while posing as disappointed patriots. The
treaty of Loudun satisfied them for the time. Several
of the King’s older Ministers were sacrificed, notably
Chancellor Sillery. The Maréchal d’Ancre had to give
up his command in Picardy, with the strong city of Amiens,
to the Duc de Longueville, but was consoled with the
military government of Normandy. A general amnesty
was published: President Le Jay was set at liberty, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
the Comte d’Auvergne was freed from his long confinement
in the Bastille; the rights already granted to the
Huguenots were confirmed; Condé’s war expenses were
paid, amounting to 1,500,000 <i>livres</i>. Decidedly a good
bargain; the best he had ever made. “This time, it is
true,” says M. Henri Martin, “Condé’s soldiers had well
earned their money: they had pillaged, burnt, ravaged
France with great zeal, from the banks of the Somme to
those of the Garonne.”</p>

<p>The other princes were also magnificently paid: their
rebellion cost the country, “according to Richelieu, more
than twenty millions”; and in the matter of places and
governments, they had what they chose to demand. In
addition, Condé claimed the right of signing the decrees
of the Royal Council. The Duc de Villeroy, a clever old
politician, advised the Queen to grant this also. It was
better, he said, to bind Monsieur le Prince to the Court
than to let him fortify himself in the provinces. “Do not
fear,” he said, “to put a pen in a man’s hand while you are
holding his arm.”</p>

<p>So ended the demonstration against the Spanish
marriages. Marie de Médicis gained her point: the
princes found effectual consolation; and the poor people
of France, as usual, paid the bill. The salt tax, which had
been reduced, was raised to its former level, and new river
tolls were established.</p>

<p>The Court lingered at Tours and at Blois until the
whole business of the treaty was concluded, and made its
triumphal entry into Paris on May 16, 1616—an unlucky
conjunction of numbers, according to astrologers. The
young Queen, a pretty and attractive girl in her indolent
Spanish way—somewhat petulant, and no wonder, considering
the miseries of the journey not to be escaped
even by queens, and the cool neglect of her boy-husband—sat
in an open litter carried by mules, for the better view
of the citizens of Paris. The noise in the streets was so
great—bells, drums and trumpets, the clatter of arms (for
the city bands were all on foot and firing off their muskets)—that
Her Majesty’s mules pranced with terror, and she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
obliged to take refuge in her coach. But the welcome of
Paris was undoubtedly hearty, and if the Spanish marriage
still caused discontent, it did not appear openly. Indeed
the Spanish embassy and their young Princess had only
to complain of the fact that the opposite party had gained
most of its ends in the treaty of Loudun, and that their
enemy, the Prince de Condé, with certain Huguenot
magnates, his allies, appeared for the moment to rule both
Court and Council.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Luçon had preceded the Court to Paris.
He had taken a house in the Rue des Mauvaises-Paroles,
in the quarter of the markets; an old street which still
existed in the early nineteenth century, but has since been
swept away. Here he was within easy reach of his Court
duties at the Louvre.</p>

<p>Under the high roofs of the palace, in the old round
towers and new pavilions and galleries, crowded in a
labyrinth of rooms and staircases, walled courts and
gardens, surrounded by a confused noise of building,
especially towards the river, where the long gallery, joining
the Louvre to the Tuileries, was not yet finished,
blocked to the west, on the site of the Place du Carrousel,
by narrow streets of great hôtels and mean houses,
churches, chapels, hospitals—lived the young King and
Queen with their households, and the Queen-Mother,
herself lodged in a low, dark, but richly furnished <i>entresol</i>,
with as many of her ladies, attendants, favourites, servants,
as could find room in the old rabbit-warren of so many
and such ghostly memories.</p>

<p>At the moment, though her personal rule was not to
last long, Marie de Médicis, the Florentine, the “fat
banker,” as Madame de Verneuil disrespectfully called her,
was the centre of power and the fountain of promotion.
It was therefore especially to her that the courtiers,
Richelieu among them, paid their devoted duty.</p>

<p>Marie de Médicis was at this time a handsome, heavy-looking
woman of forty-three; cold of temperament, grave
and haughty in manner, yet without real dignity; obstinate,
yet weak; nervous, irritable, subject to fits of violent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
anger with floods of tears; never affectionate or caressing,
even to her own children; fond of amusement, of animals,
dwarfs, freaks of nature; passionately eager for power
and magnificence; a lover of beautiful things, a generous
but ignorant patron of art; especially curious of precious
metals and stones, jewellery, bric-à-brac of all kinds; interested
in architecture, building and gardening. She laid
the first stone of her palace of “Luxembourg” in 1615,
and in this very year 1616 she planted the stately avenue
of elms, known as the Cours-la-Reine, along the river-bank
beyond the gardens of the Tuileries. Splendid in her
gifts, she was wildly extravagant, as soon as it became
possible, with the money of the State. She was superstitious
and religious, even <i>dévote</i>, after her fashion, and
the Church in France owed her much: if not refined by
nature or training, she was yet always on the side of
decency and moral reform. This is something to say for
a woman who was forced for years to live in a Court and
a society so openly and coarsely immoral, and to treat
La Reine Margot as a friend and a sister.</p>

<p>At the time when Richelieu became attached to the
Court, that eccentric princess was no longer living in her
palace opposite the Louvre. She died in the spring of
1615, shortly after the closing of the States-General. In
his memoirs the Cardinal devotes several pages to that
“greatest princess of her time,” her talents and her
charities.</p>

<p>At the Louvre, next to the Queen-Mother, the most
profitable objects of a courtier’s devotion were the Maréchal
and the Maréchale d’Ancre. They were Marie’s most
intimate and inseparable friends. Unworthy of such a
position, no doubt: but the wife of Henry IV. was hardly
happy enough willingly to dispense with those who had
followed her from Florence. Leonora Galigaï, her nurse’s
daughter, first the companion of her childhood, had been
appointed head of her maids: of low birth, but extremely
clever, and only too capable of managing her mistress;
though her own supposed account of her influence, “that
of a clever woman over a dull fool,” seems to have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
one of the many inventions of her enemies. A small,
dark, ugly, keen-faced creature, Leonora had fallen in love
with the handsome adventurer Concini, who had followed
the Queen to France in search of fortune. They were
married, and together they climbed the heights they
desired. Concini swaggered among nobles and princes,
the very type of a royal favourite. He was an insolent,
magnificent bully, with whom the greatest in the land had
to reckon. Yet, though envied and slandered, he was not
entirely unpopular, even at Court. Bassompierre observed
that he was neither perfection nor a fool. He had the
daring courage which came of belief in his own lucky
star. He was good-natured and kind, except to his wife;
with her, in spite of their mutual interests, he quarrelled
incessantly, and they lived mostly apart. But the many
scandalous jokes, songs and stories which dealt with the
supposed love-affairs of Concini and the Queen are pronounced
by modern historians to be without foundation.</p>

<p>For some years the husband and wife concerned themselves
little with politics. Money and position, especially
money, of which Leonora was excessively greedy, were
their favourite objects. They bought a palace in the Rue de
Tournon, near the old Hôtel de Luxembourg, and furnished
it splendidly. But Concini lived chiefly in a house near
the river, at the south-east corner of the small garden of
the Louvre, between it and the old Hôtel de Bourbon. By
a bridge from the house to the garden he could communicate
with his wife’s apartments, above those of the
Queen.</p>

<p>Leonora left her rooms seldom and unwillingly, except
for necessary attendance on her mistress. She was a
nervous invalid, and depended much on Jewish doctors,
quack remedies, and—according to her enemies—the black
art. We are also told, however, that she confessed
regularly and caused the Bible to be read to her. M.
Batiffol, in his picturesque study of the time, describes
how she sat all day threading beads or playing the guitar—she
was a fine musician—in the midst of rich hoards of
every description: tapestry, embroidery, mirrors, cabinets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
carpets, cushions, counterpanes, of the most splendid
materials; endless quantities of gold and silver plate;
wardrobes and chests full of beautiful garments that she
seldom wore. Beyond these treasures, she cared for little
but money: when she meddled with politics, it was for
the sake of money, or for her husband’s advancement;
and this last matter interested her keenly in the exciting
changes of that winter, which had carried her, sorely
against her will, on a most trying journey.</p>

<p>The return from that journey found the Maréchal d’Ancre,
now Lieutenant-General of Normandy, at the height of his
power, though a quarrel with the people of the markets
lost him some popularity. The reconstruction of the
Ministry, the fall of Sillery, the temporary superseding
of Jeannin, President of the Council, and later of the
Duc de Villeroy, left the way open for clever men such
as Barbin and Mangot, both followers of Concini. Both
admirers, too, of the Bishop of Luçon, who very soon,
by their means, was to become a Minister of State.</p>

<p>From the point of view of a courtier or a politician, the
inmates of the Louvre least worth considering were the
young King and Queen. Both were born in 1601, and
in that summer were not quite fifteen years old: two
children, with the minds and tastes of children, on whom
etiquette weighed heavily, who were shy of each other, and
cared only for their own chosen companions and sports.</p>

<p>The little Queen seems to have been singularly childish,
for a princess brought up in the stately Court of Spain.
Surrounded at first by her Spanish ladies, who adored
and petted her, she made grave ambassadors anxious,
though her coquettish beauty attracted the French. But
there was a lack of majesty, a love of jokes and games,
an impatience of everything serious, a quick and wilful
temper, an amazingly short memory, combined with a
frank regret for her old life—“bien souvent l’Espagne me
manque,” she wrote home in the early days—hardly suitable
to a Queen of France. Her new subjects did not
complain; in truth, after the first rejoicings of her arrival,
they saw little of her. Sometimes she appeared at Court<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
balls, ballets and <i>carrousels</i>, brilliant in her fresh youth,
with her dazzlingly white skin, large eyes, chestnut hair,
and the exquisite hands which were her crowning beauty.
Sometimes she drove out in a coach to Saint-Germain,
and spent the day hunting and hawking with the King,
who hardly cared for her company at any other time. Her
chaplain, the Bishop of Luçon, attended on her at the
Louvre as a most formal duty. Personally, Anne never
liked him. Though not yet too terrible, he was always
too serious for her. But the Spanish ambassador wrote
of him to Philip III.: “There are not two men in France
so zealous for the service of God, of our Crown, and of
the public weal.”</p>

<p>Time was to show whether his Excellency was right on
all or any of these points.</p>

<p>Louis XIII. had been an attractive little child, and was
now a handsome, simple, straightforward boy, whose health
and temper, unluckily, had been ruined by mismanagement.
The diary of his physician, Hérouard—curious if unpleasant
reading—shows us a child brought up on pills and potions
quite as much as on food. Add constant and severe whippings
for every small fault, and we have the training that
Henry IV. and Marie de Médicis, here in entire agreement,
thought fitting for their eldest son. Long after Louis was
King of France the floggings continued, enraging interludes
to Court etiquette and ceremonies. “Give me less
manners and less whipping!” the poor boy cried one
day, when his mother and her ladies rose and curtseyed
on His Majesty’s entrance.</p>

<p>No wonder that the face he turned to the outside world—including,
for him, his mother and his wife—was sulky
and misanthropic. He had affection to give; but it was
all for the one or two special friends who understood
him, and who made it their business to help and indulge
him in the sports he cared about; hunting and hawking
three or four days a week in the forests and the open
country near Paris; while in the intervals there were
rabbits and small birds to be caught in the precincts of
the Louvre and the Tuileries, and on wet days various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
indoor amusements—cooking, carpentering, turning, teaching
his little dogs tricks, building card castles, and so on.
He was passionately fond of music. Court functions bored
him terribly; and though forced, after his majority, to
attend the Council that ruled in his name, and behaving
there with sufficient dignity and intelligence, he took very
little active interest in affairs of State. This carelessness,
though more apparent than real, exactly suited his mother,
her favourites and her ministers. France was given to
understand that the young King was too delicate, too
incapable, to act for himself in any public way.</p>

<p>It was not unnatural that all who had political or social
ends to gain should have thought it safe to ignore the King
and Queen as children of no account. But Louis XIII.
had one trusted friend; and the Bishop of Luçon, with
many others, was bitterly to repent a too low estimation
of the powers of the Sieur de Luynes.</p>

<p>Charles d’Albert de Luynes was now a man of eight-and-thirty.
He was the eldest son of a small land-owner
in Provence, and took his territorial name from a fief near
Aix, which was his mother’s dowry. His two younger
brothers, Honoré and Léon, who shared his marvellous
fortunes—one becoming Duc de Chaulnes, the other Duc
de Piney-Luxembourg—were known in their earlier days as
Seigneurs de Cadenet and de Brantes; Cadenet being a
small island in the Rhône, Brantes a farm and vineyard
on a hill at Mornas. The three brothers, all clever and
amiable, caring for each other with an unselfish affection
rare in those days, began life as pages to François de
Daillon, Comte du Lude, a very great man in his own
province of Anjou, and a witty and audacious courtier.
He and his friend M. de la Varenne advanced the three
young southerners to the service of King Henry IV.,
who gave them appointments in the Dauphin’s household.
Even then the three, generally liked and esteemed,
says Richelieu, had but one pony and one good coat
amongst them.</p>

<p>It was not only his skill in falconry and all other kinds
of sport which endeared Luynes to his young master.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
From the first he made himself his friend. He was a
really good-natured man, as well as a fine sportsman and
an ambitious courtier, and he laid himself out to give
freedom and happiness to the oppressed, stammering boy.
Louis learned, from a child, to fly to Luynes in all his
troubles. He was his constant companion through the
day, his chief playmate, the organiser of his leisure time.
At night in his dreams, often restless and feverish, the
boy would cry out for Luynes.</p>

<p>This high favour did not pass unnoticed, of course, by
the Queen-mother and Concini. They might have crushed
Luynes in the early days, but they took the line of
propitiating him—a very great and fatal mistake, according
to Richelieu. Marie gave him the government of Amboise,
resigned by the Prince de Condé in 1615. She thought
thus to make Luynes her creature; and the Maréchal
d’Ancre, who had watched him anxiously for a short time,
was deceived by his retiring manners into thinking him
a man of no real account except among birds, but probably
a useful friend, having the ear of the King.</p>

<p>Through this summer of 1616, the Bishop of Luçon was
steadily advancing in favour. Marie de Médicis appointed
him her private secretary, with a handsome pension, and
employed him on several political missions. One of these
was of real importance and led to striking results.</p>

<p>In spite of the treaty of Loudun and all its advantages,
the Prince de Condé and his friends were still in a sulky
frame of mind. Instead of coming at once to Paris, the
Prince lingered in his new province of Berry, where
the discontented showed signs of gathering round him
once more. This temper of his caused much anxiety to
Marie, her new Ministers, and the Maréchal d’Ancre. It
seemed to them necessary that the Prince should come
to Paris. Any fresh disloyalty would be less formidable
there, and his support of the present government, if he
chose to give it, would be more valuable.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Luçon was sent to negotiate with the
Prince at Bourges. “The Queen sent me to him,” he
says, “believing that I should have sufficient fidelity and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
skill to dissipate the clouds of suspicion which evil minds
had falsely raised against her.” Her belief was justified.
Her envoy not only made the most of the promises with
which he was laden—promises from herself, from the
Maréchal d’Ancre, and last, not least, from Leonora—but
he worked on the Prince’s mind by his own clever and
flattering persuasions, assisted probably by the influence
of Père Joseph and his brother, M. du Tremblay, who
were partisans of Condé.</p>

<p>The Prince came to Paris, and was honourably received
by their Majesties at the Louvre. Immediately all Paris
was at his feet. “The Louvre was a solitude,” says
Richelieu; “his house was the old Louvre”—on the site
of part of the fortress of Philippe Auguste—“and one
could not approach the door for the multitude of people
crowding there. All who had any affair on hand addressed
themselves to him; he never entered the Council but his
hands were full of petitions and memoirs which had been
presented to him, and which were granted at his will.”</p>

<p>At first Condé enjoyed his new popularity and used
his power with moderation. Had he been a wise man,
he might have kept it long; but he was weak, dissipated,
and fiercely ambitious, saying openly that he had as
much right to the throne as the King himself. The other
princes, especially the restless and intriguing Duc de
Bouillon, worked upon his discontent. Naturally, their
first object was the ruin of the Maréchal d’Ancre. Each
of them had grievances of his own. Even the Ducs de
Guise and d’Épernon, loyal to the Crown, were ready to
draw their swords on the favourite. The former Ministers,
the Parliament, the people of Paris, were all on the same
side, and Concini’s life, darkly plotted against in high
places, was openly threatened in the street. One day,
going alone to visit the Prince, who was entertaining
the English ambassador, Lord Hay, he had a narrow
escape of being killed by the servants.</p>

<p>Concini was a brave man, but he realised his danger,
and both he and his wife were on the eve of escaping
from France. Suddenly, however, the whole face of things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
changed. The Queen-mother, solemnly warned by the
Duc de Sully, saw that some bold step was necessary if
she was to save herself, her friends, even the young King,
from serious peril. For there were again grumblings of
civil war in the provinces, where the Duc de Longueville
was attacking the last fortress in Picardy which remained
in Concini’s hands.</p>

<p>The Ministers Barbin and Mangot, with the Bishop
of Luçon, advised a <i>coup d’état</i>, and it was carried out with
extraordinary ease. The Prince de Condé was arrested
and imprisoned in the Bastille. The other princes fled,
and Concini triumphed once more; but the people of
Paris showed their hatred by sacking his palace in the
Rue de Tournon, full of treasures worth 200,000 crowns.</p>

<p>On November 14, according to the registers of the
parish of Braye, “s’en est allée de vie à trépas noble
dame Suzanne de la Porte, dame de Richelieu.” The
Bishop of Luçon writes to his brother Alphonse:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,—I regret much that you must
learn by this letter our common loss of our poor mother,
although I know that for you it will be the more bearable
in that, having yourself renounced the world to gain
heaven, her life and her death give you certain assurance
of meeting her again there; since in the latter God gave
her as much grace, consolation, and sweetness as in the
former she had suffered contradiction, affliction and
bitterness.... For myself, I pray God that in future her
good example and yours may so profit me that I may
amend my life.”</p>
</div>

<p>M. Avenel gives a letter from Henry de Richelieu, the
head of the family, to his sister Nicole (afterwards Madame
de Maillé-Brézé), begging her to lay their mother’s body,
as honourably as possible, in the chapel of the château,
there to await himself and the Bishop, “that we may
all together bear her to the grave.”</p>

<p>It was not till December 8 that “noble dame Suzanne
de la Porte” was laid in the family vault under the church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
of Braye. But it appears that her son Armand was waited
for in vain. There was question of a special embassy to
Spain on the affairs of the Duke of Savoy; there was
the immediate prospect of becoming a Minister of France.
Indeed, he was already one of a triumvirate—Barbin,
Mangot, Richelieu—on whom, under Concini, depended
all affairs of State. Between his mother’s death and her
funeral, he was writing letters vowing eternal gratitude
both to the Maréchal and to Leonora, through whose
favour and consideration alone, he declared, their Majesties
had been pleased to appoint him Secretary for Foreign
Affairs.</p>

<p>The Sieur de Pontchartrain, in his <i>Memoirs</i>, gives a
vivid account of the state of France in the winter of
1616-17. He was not exactly an impartial judge,
since he had himself been a Minister of State under the
Duc de Villeroy, and he saw things from his patron’s point
of view. But he was an honest man.</p>

<p>Like Sully, he entirely failed to realise the political
genius of the Bishop of Luçon, treating him and his
colleagues as contemptible creatures of Concini. He
writes of “the bad management of affairs, the small regard
shown by the Queen-mother for the King, from whom all
affairs are concealed, the unjust detention of M. le Prince
de Condé and the alienation of all the other princes and
great men, the ambitious designs, hurtful to France, of
the Maréchal d’Ancre and of his wife, the banishment
from affairs of all the old Ministers of State, and the
establishment of two or three who have neither merit
nor experience, except as ministering to the passions of
the Maréchal and his wife (these were M. Mangot, Barbin,
and Richelieu-Luçon).... Thus all things were embroiled;
and in order to fortify herself against evil designs, the
Queen-mother, assisted by the counsel of the said Maréchal
d’Ancre and of the said <i>sieurs</i> Barbin, Mangot, and Richelieu,
Bishop of Luçon, resolved to prepare openly for war.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>Pontchartrain concludes that the sole motive of this
worthless and tyrannical council was to maintain the
Maréchal in absolute power: also that under the confusion
of war expenditure might be concealed the “great gifts,
pensions and appointments” which he took from the
national finances.</p>

<p>That the Queen-mother was wrong-headed and foolish,
that Concini’s haughty swagger and Leonora’s avarice and
secret intrigues were hateful and degrading elements in
both Court and government, no one can deny. But those
who stand farther off than Pontchartrain may see what
was hidden from him, and probably from many worthy
persons of his day—that Barbin, Mangot and Richelieu
were not unpatriotic in advising war against the rebel
princes and nobles, whose motives, after all, were no purer
than those of Concini.</p>

<p>As to themselves, Barbin was a man of clean hands,
a rare attribute in those days; clear-headed and wise.
Mangot, if not brilliant, had the merit of being loyal to his
colleagues. Richelieu, in this first short ministry, gave
every sign of future greatness, and in a way which makes
not only Pontchartrain, but Sully, seem unnaturally blind.
Henry’s old Minister was one of those who spoke most
slightingly of the man who, more than any other, was to
carry on Henry’s foreign policy.</p>

<p>He was amazingly eager and young. He sprang into
office like a soldier into the saddle, his whole mind and
body devoted at once to the service of his country. The
administration of his poor little diocese had taught him
to command men. That those who worked with him felt
his superiority, not only in position but in talent, is shown
by the fact that he was at once given precedence over the
other Ministers. The Comte de Brienne resented this,
observing in an unfriendly manner that a Bishop should
reside in his diocese. The Maréchal d’Ancre, on the other
hand, pressed Richelieu to resign his see. His motive was
plain, and had nothing to do with the welfare of the people
of Luçon: being thus deprived of his chief means of living,
the young Minister would be entirely dependent on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
patron’s will. Richelieu was far too clever to yield, and
the advice of his friend Barbin strengthened his refusal.
“Considering the changes which might come about, either
through the changeable humours of that personage or by
accidents to his fortune, I would never consent, which
made him unreasonably angry.”</p>

<p>He resigned his post of chaplain to the reigning Queen, in
which he was succeeded by the young Bishop of Langres,
Sébastien Zamet, second son of the great financier, and afterwards
a conspicuous figure in the history of Port-Royal.</p>

<p>The first duty of the new Ministers was to crush a
new rebellion, for the Ducs de Bouillon and de Nevers,
demanding the release of Condé and the fall of Concini,
had set the east of France in a blaze. Three armies had
to be raised and sent to meet them. The commanders
were chosen—the Comte d’Auvergne, the Duc de Guise,
the Maréchal de Montigny; a harder matter was to find
the men and the money. By means of a new tax, Richelieu
and Barbin were able to hire a few thousand mercenaries
from Flanders, Germany, Holland and Switzerland; the
rest were recruited in France by gentlemen who took a
heavy commission on their loyal work: indeed, as usual,
the soldiers saw little of their promised pay, and were
driven, as usual, to extract a living from the wretched
people of the provinces. Champagne, the Île de France,
the Nivernais, suffered in this winter of 1616 as Berry,
Touraine and Poitou had done twelve months before.</p>

<p>One of the complaints of the malcontent princes against
the government was the state of the national finances; in
truth, the half-dozen years since Henry’s death had reduced
France from relative prosperity to something very like
bankruptcy. But Richelieu retorted on the princes by
a published statement, meant to enlighten the country as
to the fate of some of its funds. The Prince de Condé
had received 3,665,990 <i>livres</i>; the late Comte de Soissons,
his wife and son (Charles de Bourbon died in 1612, and
his family were even more restless and greedy than himself),
1,600,000 <i>livres</i>; the old Prince de Conti, now also
dead, and his worldly widow, 1,400,000 <i>livres</i>; the Duc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
de Longueville, 1,200,000 <i>livres</i>; the Duc de Mayenne,
2,000,000 <i>livres</i>; the Duc de Vendôme, 600,000 <i>livres</i>; the
Duc d’Épernon, 700,000 <i>livres</i>; the Duc de Bouillon,
1,000,000 <i>livres</i>; all, says M. Martin, without counting
“salaries, pensions, and gifts to their friends and servants.”
As a <i>livre</i> was about the same as a franc, and then worth
five times as much as now, the smallest of these “gratifications”
was equal to £120,000, and the largest to nearly
£800,000 sterling. It must be added that the eight Marshals
of France and six other great officers of the Crown received
four times as much as in the days of Henry.</p>

<p>The royal armies were successful; they drove the
princes before them, destroying their strongholds, and
besieged them in the fortified towns to which they retreated.
“They were in despair,” says Pontchartrain. Henry de
Richelieu, a keen and good soldier, served as aide-de-camp
to the Maréchal de Montigny.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Richelieu, as Secretary of State,
gave the Powers of Europe the first intimation that French
policy was not for ever to be bound up with the interests of
Spain—a great change, after nearly seven years of Marie
de Médicis’ rule, and a striking forecast of the future.
England, Holland, and Germany were assured of the friendship
of France, on the understanding that no assistance
was given to the rebel princes. The Spanish marriages,
Richelieu’s ambassadors assured the Protestant Powers,
did not bind Louis XIII. either to Rome or to Spain “to
the prejudice of our ancient allies.” The King would give
equal treatment to his subjects of either religion. “No
Catholic is so blind as to esteem a Spaniard, in matters of
State, more highly than a French Huguenot.”</p>

<p>Independence of Spain had already been practically
shown by Richelieu in not forbidding the Duc de Lesdiguières,
governor of Dauphiné, himself a distinguished
Huguenot, to lead an army of his own across the Alps in
order to support Duke Charles Emmanuel of Savoy in his
quarrel with the Spanish Viceroy of Milan.</p>

<p>Thus Richelieu was already giving Europe a taste of his
strength, and advancing, fast and fearlessly, beyond the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
narrow lines of the Bishop of Luçon’s courtly speech before
the States-General. He was no longer “the man of the
clergy,” but “the man of France.” Naturally he was losing
the confidence of his empty-headed patron, who scolded
the Ministers like schoolboys and was violently jealous of
Richelieu’s growing influence with the Queen.</p>

<p>“By God, sir,” he wrote to him on some small matter of
discontent, “I complain of you: you treat me too ill; you
treat for peace without me; you make the Queen write to
me that for the love of her I am to cease my pursuit of
M. de Montbazon for the money he owes me. In the name
of all the devils, what do you and the Queen expect me to
do? Rage gnaws me to the bones.”</p>

<p>A Ministry that depended on such a favourite was on
a slippery slope indeed. The difficulties, at home and
abroad, were enormous, and the wonder is that Richelieu
and his colleagues, during their few months of uncertain
power, were able to do so much.</p>

<p>Just at this time, when he was fighting the princes and
parleying with Europe, the Abbé de Marolles gives a snapshot
of him worth many formal portraits. The Abbé was
then a young scholar at the university. His father, Claude
de Marolles, a well-known soldier and courtier, once commanding
the Swiss Guard, had joined the rebel princes and
was attempting to negotiate between the Duc de Nevers
and the commanders of the royal army.</p>

<p>M. Mangot, the Keeper of the Seals, sent for young
Michel de Marolles and inquired of him whether he had
received letters from his father or had had news from any
of his father’s people. He warned him to hide nothing of
the truth—“parce qu’il y alloit du service du roi.”</p>

<p>“There was M. de Luçon, in black, flung back (<i>renversé</i>)
in a leathern chair, while M. le Garde des Sceaux stood up
while speaking to me....” Presently, “M. de Luçon, who
knew my father pretty well and esteemed him, rose up in
his chair and said that in truth he did not believe that
M. de Marolles had turned against the King’s service of his
own free will, but that he was sorry he should have found
himself engaged in so bad a cause. Then he added very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
low that I might retire, and that he did not advise me to
remain in Paris.”</p>

<p>Such a warning, in those days, was not to be despised,
and the young scholar was sent to his home in Touraine.</p>

<p>In spite of the political and military successes of the
Ministers he was supposed to rule, the storm which overwhelmed
the unlucky Concini was gathering all through
that winter at the Louvre. Paris was careless and gay:
after letting out her rage by sacking his house, she was
content to enjoy the scurrilous songs and pamphlets, her
favourite food, which rang through the streets and were
sold by hundreds on the Pont Neuf.</p>

<p>“The year began joyously,” writes Bassompierre, a
lighter-hearted witness than Pontchartrain, and a loyal
courtier of Marie de Médicis. “Many fine assemblies, at
which, besides gambling, feasting, and comedy, there was
also good music. Time passed pleasantly at the Fair of
Saint-Germain.”</p>

<p>The Maréchal and Leonora shared little in these amusements.
He, at least, was troubled with a heavy presentiment
of misfortune to come, and a present grief, the illness
and death of their little daughter, caused them both “un
cruel déplaisir.” The friendly soul Bassompierre, who had
known him in his Florentine days, visited them in their
sorrow on the very day of the child’s death. He found
them together, “fort affligés,” in the little house close to
the Louvre.</p>

<p>“I tried as well as I could to console or divert him, but
the more I spoke the more he grieved, and weeping
answered me nothing, except “<i>Seignor</i>, je suis perdu;
<i>seignor</i>, je suis ruiné; <i>seignor</i>, je suis misérable.”</p>

<p>Bassompierre begged him to consider that he was a
Marshal of France, and therefore that such lamentations,
though worthy of his wife, were unworthy of him; adding
in the candid fashion of the time that although he had lost
an amiable daughter he had yet four nieces, by whose
means he might ally himself with any four great French
houses that he might choose—“and many other things
which God inspired me to say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, monsieur,” replied Concini, “I truly mourn my
daughter, and shall mourn her as long as I live. Nevertheless,
I am a man able to endure with constancy a grief
such as this; but the ruin of myself and my wife, my
son and my house, which I see before my eyes, and
which my wife’s obstinacy makes inevitable, causes me
to lament and to lose patience.”</p>

<p>He went on to tell Bassompierre the familiar story of
his life, curious enough from his own point of view.
According to him, he had been perfectly happy and
prosperous till within the last few months—since, in fact,
to outward view, he had possessed almost sovereign power.
His excitable southern nature was not made to stand firm
against the assaults of fortune, party hatred, popular fury
and insult; in all this he saw warnings from heaven of
coming ruin, terrible and complete. On his knees, he
said, he had implored his wife to retire with him to
Italy, where with their immense fortune they could
establish themselves magnificently and leave a fine heritage
to their son. But the Maréchale, with more courage, if
also with a more greedy, unsatisfied ambition, absolutely
refused to leave France. It was cowardly and ungrateful,
she said, to think of forsaking the Queen, to whom they
owed their honours and their wealth. “If it were not
for my obligations to my wife,” he said, “I would leave
her, and go where neither nobles of France nor common
people would follow and find me.”</p>

<p>Bassompierre went away reflecting how men uplifted
by fortune are often inspired to foresee a coming fall; but
also how seldom they have resolution enough to avoid it.</p>

<p>If Concini was sincere in his wish to leave his dangerous
eminence, this episode throws a tragic light on his conduct
during the first three months of 1617. His insolent bravado
at Court and elsewhere seems now the desperation of
an adventurer fighting hopelessly for his life. It was
hardly necessary for M. de Luynes to poison the King’s
mind against the Maréchal d’Ancre; he did it himself. A
day seldom passed without some new insult, some fresh
mark of disrespect shown to Royalty. The Maréchal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
laughed at the boy, teased him, did not uncover in his
presence. Standing with one or two attendants at a
window in the Louvre, Louis looked down with proud
and gloomy eyes on the Maréchal’s splendid suite as it
pranced in the courtyard without a salute to spare for
him. When the King wanted money—which frequently
happened, for his mother did not indulge him in that
way or any other—the Maréchal asked him, with an air
of dashing liberality which deeply offended the boy, why
he had not applied to him.</p>

<p>Luynes was an ambitious man, of course; but any
loyal servant of the King would have done well to be
angry, and Concini, by refusing him one of his nieces
in marriage, had made a personal enemy of him. While
Louis, sad and bored from childhood, went his melancholy
way, catching little birds, wheeling barrows of turf to
make banks in the Tuileries gardens, his handsome falconer
was always there, whispering a deeper discontent into
ears by no means dull. The removal of Concini, his wife
and his parasites, would mean the Queen-mother’s fall
from the height of power she had usurped ever since
the King was declared major, thus ending her regency.
It would mean the submission of the rebel princes and
nobles, who were even now declaring themselves, by
secret letters and messages, faithful servants of the King.
It would seat Louis XIII. on his father’s throne.</p>

<p>There was only one way. Louis was at first unwilling
that the Maréchal should be killed. He discussed other
plans with Luynes and two or three confidants. He might
escape from Paris to Amboise, where a brother of Luynes
was in command and where his friends might gather round
him; or he might join the princes, taking the command of
their forces, which would thus become his own. These
ideas reached the Queen-mother, and his guards were
changed for others whom she could trust. Escape was
made impossible, and from that time Concini was doomed.</p>

<p>Luynes and his fellows, with the King’s full consent,
plotted the affair with M. de Vitry, captain of the guard,
a bold, resolute man. On the morning of Monday, April 24,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
this officer with a few companions met Concini at the
entrance of the Louvre on his way to pay his daily visit
to the Queen.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Vitry, “I arrest you, by order of the King.”</p>

<p>“À moi!” cried Concini, laying his hand on his sword;
but before his train of startled courtiers knew what was
happening, three of Vitry’s men had fired their pistols
in his face; he fell dead, shot through the brain.</p>

<p>Not a sword was drawn to avenge him; the words “By
order of the King,” had suddenly recovered their old magic
power, and the whole palace echoed with “Vive le Roi!”</p>

<p>On that fatal morning, the Bishop of Luçon was paying
an early visit to a distinguished doctor of the Sorbonne,
one of the rectors of the University. The news reached
the two theologians by means of a third, who brought
it from the Palais de Justice. M. d’Ornano, one of the
conspirators, had been sent there direct from the Louvre
to inform the Parliament of what had happened: such a
precaution was necessary, for Paris was already in an
uproar. Rumour cried in the streets that the young King
had been wounded, and by the hand of the Maréchal.
The shops were hastily shut and crowds were pouring
towards the Louvre, to meet the news that the King was
well and the Maréchal dead. Then Paris burst into
acclamations of joy.</p>

<p>For the Bishop of Luçon the event was of the most
serious consequence, but he wasted neither time nor words
in lamenting his patron.</p>

<p>“I was the more surprised,” he says, “as I had never
foreseen that those who were near the King would be
strong enough to design such an enterprise. I immediately
quitted the company of that doctor, famous both for his
teaching and his virtue, who did not forget to say quite
<i>à propos</i> what I might have expected from a man of his
learning—as to the inconstancy of fortune and the uncertainty
of all that may seem most settled in human life.”</p>

<p>On the Pont Neuf, as he drove home, the Bishop met
his friend M. du Tremblay, full of the news, who told him
that the King was inquiring for him. Before presenting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
himself at the Louvre, he sought out his terrified colleagues,
Mangot and Barbin, who feared the worst for themselves
and for him. It was agreed that they should go one by
one, the Bishop first, to receive His Majesty’s commands.</p>

<p>It was the first really alarming crisis in Richelieu’s life.
There is no doubt that so clever a man must have expected
something of the kind, must have known that the favourite’s
tyranny could not last for ever. It was only a few days
indeed since he and Barbin, having discovered that Concini
meant to get rid of them and to replace them with more
submissive Ministers, had privately offered their resignation
to the Queen, who refused to receive it. Also, it seems,
with a view to his own safety, Richelieu had made some
advances towards friendship with M. de Luynes. But, for
all that, the moment was dangerous. Both Court and
populace were likely to turn against those who had owed
their power to the dead Maréchal; various threats and
warnings had already reached the ears of Barbin. For
Richelieu himself, as he mounted the grand staircase of the
Louvre, the signs were not exactly favourable. “I saw
many faces of those who had caressed me two hours
before, and who now did not recognise me.”</p>

<p>In the great gallery, crowded with courtiers and armed
men, young Louis XIII. was standing on a billiard table, to
be seen by all. There is a picturesque story that he cried
out, on seeing the Bishop approach, “Eh bien, Luçon!
me voilà hors de votre tyrannie!” Whatever the boy may
have thought or said, M. de Luynes was not so impolitic as
to make a mortal enemy of the most brilliant man in the
kingdom. Mangot might be scornfully neglected, Barbin
might be imprisoned—as they were—but Luçon seemed
worth winning, or at least keeping in the balance till the
King and his mother had arranged their differences.</p>

<p>According to Richelieu’s own account, the King spoke
to him kindly—“saying that he knew I had always loved
him (he used those words) and had taken his part on various
occasions, in consideration of which he would treat me
well.” M. de Luynes joined in, with protestations of friendship.
But this was merely personal. When Richelieu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
tried to plead for his colleagues, who deserved the royal
favour neither more nor less than himself, Luynes would
not listen. He also replied very coldly to the Bishop’s
request to see the Queen-mother, now strictly guarded in
her own rooms.</p>

<p>He gave him to understand, however, that he was still
of the royal Council, and advised him to present himself
in the Council-chamber. Richelieu did so; but only to be
treated as an intruder. The old Ministers, Villeroy, Jeannin
and the rest, were already in their former places, and were
deeply engaged in the business of reversing Richelieu’s
policy; while sending despatches to all the provinces, to
the armies, to the rebel princes and to foreign courts with
the news that the King of France had at length come to
his own.</p>

<p>It was a curious position for the late Secretary of State.
After standing for a few minutes inside the door, speaking
to one or two councillors, he thought it best to retire
quietly, and went home to his house.</p>

<p>At the Louvre, shut up in her apartments, but still
surrounded by her ladies, the Queen-mother lamented with
hard, tearless passion—not the death of her favourite,
which troubled her little, but the loss of her own authority.
Fear of the future and of her son’s vengeance filled her
mind, to the exclusion of every other human feeling. She
had no pity to spare even for the miserable Leonora, her
lifelong friend, who was seized by the guards immediately
after her husband’s death, plundered of all her treasures
and imprisoned, first in the Louvre, then in the Bastille,
her son Henry Concini, a boy of thirteen, having been torn
from her. The little Comte de la Pena, as they called him,
was a pretty boy and a famous dancer. The Comte de
Fiesque, the young Queen’s equerry, took him under his
protection and brought him to her. Anne made him dance,
fed him with sweetmeats, and kept him in her household
till his fatal name condemned him also to prison. Some
time later, he was set free and sent back to Italy.</p>

<p>The murderers of Concini robbed his dead body of
money and jewellery and left it lying under a staircase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
in the court of the Louvre, near the gate through which
crowds of Parisians of every rank, who had trembled
before the Maréchal, came crowding to pay their homage
to the King. During the day his house near the Louvre
and his wife’s apartments were completely sacked and
pillaged, their flying servants chased in all directions. In
the evening his body was carried secretly across the way
to the Church of Saint-Germain l’Auxerrois and buried,
with no funeral rites, behind the organ.</p>

<p>But the fury and rage of the mob were far from being
satisfied. The Parisians of 1617 were the ancestors of
those of 1793. “The next morning,” says Pontchartrain,
“the 25th of the said month of April, day of Saint Mark,
about ten o’clock, a few women and children, in the Church
of Saint-Germain of the Auxerrois, began to say one to
another, standing over the place where he had been interred:
‘See where they have buried that tyrant: is it
right that he, who did so much evil, should lie in holy
ground and in a church? No, no; out with him; throw
him on a dunghill!’ And exciting each other with such
words, they began with sticks to break up the stone under
which the body lay; the women using knives and scissors,
until strong men began to lend a hand. In less than half
an hour two or three hundred persons were assembled;
they raise the stone, take out the body, tie cords round the
neck, drag it out of the church and thence through the
streets, with horrible shouts and yells, some saying it
should be thrown into the river, others that it should be
burnt, others that it should be hanged on a gibbet; each
one worse than the last. Thus they found themselves at
the end of the Pont Neuf, where there were two or three
gibbets set up.”</p>

<p>Gibbets had been planted here and there in the city by
Concini’s orders, “to frighten those who dared speak ill
of him.” To cut the horrible story short, they hanged his
dead body on one of these and then tore it to pieces with
the savagery of wild beasts, burning part and throwing
part into the river.</p>

<p>Richelieu was an eye-witness of these horrors. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
on his way to visit the Pope’s Nuncio, and his coach drove
on to the bridge, a favourite thoroughfare, to find it a mass
of people absorbed in their dreadful work and “so drunk
with fury that there was no means of getting them to make
way for the passage of coaches.”</p>

<p>The Bishop’s coachman was indiscreet enough to take
matters with the usual high hand and to attempt to force
his way. One of the men who was roughly hustled made
a loud complaint.</p>

<p>“At that instant,” Richelieu writes, “I saw my peril, in
case any one should cry out that I was a partisan of
the Maréchal d’Ancre. To save myself, after violently
threatening my coachman, I asked them what they were
doing, and when they had answered me according to their
fury against the Maréchal, I said to them, ‘You are men
who would die to serve the King: shout, all of you, <i>Vive
le Roi!</i>’ I led them off, and thus I gained free passage,
and I took good care not to return the same way; I
recrossed by the Pont Notre Dame.”</p>

<p>A few days later, after a painful interview with her son—at
which her stony calm broke down and she wept
bitterly—and after formal farewells from court and city,
Marie de Médicis quitted Paris for an honourable captivity
at the Château de Blois. Her younger children took leave
of her at the gate of the city. She was accompanied by a
train of faithful servants, French and Italian, among whom
the most distinguished was the Bishop of Luçon; it was
largely owing to his influence with Luynes that the Queen
had not been treated with greater severity.</p>

<p>Two months later, after an unfair and absurd trial, the
Maréchale d’Ancre was beheaded in the Place de Grève and
her remains burnt to ashes. Most of the money, property,
and possessions which she and her husband had accumulated
during their years of power was bestowed upon the King’s
friend and favourite, now Duc de Luynes and Lieutenant-General
of Normandy. For his own not very considerable
share in the ruin and death of Concini and his wife,
Louis XIII. was rewarded by the French people with the
title of “Le Juste.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Richelieu at Blois—He is ordered back to his diocese—He writes a
book in defence of the faith—Marriage of Mademoiselle de Richelieu—The
Bishop exiled to Avignon—Escape of the Queen-mother from Blois—Richelieu
is recalled to her service.</p>

</div>
<p>In this swift and sudden way Richelieu fell from power.
The position in which he now found himself was
difficult enough. He was the Queen-mother’s chief
friend and confidant in the early days of her exile at Blois,
and the head of her council, but he was surrounded by
mischievous rivals, some Italian, some French, who played
him false and undermined his influence. The Queen’s
household, following its royal mistress’s lead, was all plot
and intrigue, delusion and fury. Almost the only wise
person, besides Richelieu himself, was his old friend
Madame de Guercheville, Marie’s lady of honour. She, at
least, saw good cause for the Bishop of Luçon’s endeavour
to keep the little captive Court at Blois in favour with the
Court of the Louvre by a constant and civil correspondence
with the almighty Luynes. She saw the force of the
Bishop’s reasoning—that the actual state of things must be
accepted—that the King was the King, and his subjects,
including his mother, might as well rebel against Heaven.
Therefore Richelieu was doing his best for Her Majesty—and
incidentally for himself too—by representing her and
her servants as absolutely devoted to the service of the
King.</p>

<p>It is natural enough that Luynes, listening to Richelieu’s
enemies, was not inclined to trust him, either as to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
Queen-mother’s peaceable loyalty or his own. But he
made no mistake as to the Bishop’s political genius; and
therefore, it seems, he decided to deprive the Queen-mother
of his services.</p>

<p>The intrigue is not very clear, even to this day. Richelieu
had a letter from his brother, the Marquis, warning
him that the King was displeased with him and that he
would shortly be ordered to retire to his diocese. Afterwards
it appeared that the information, conveyed by friends
at Court to Henry de Richelieu, was false, or at least
premature. But the Bishop acted on it without delay.
Knowing that Marie would not willingly part with him, he
asked for a fortnight’s leave of absence and went to the
Château de Richelieu. From thence he wrote to the King
and to Luynes, protesting his loyalty and complaining of
the calumnies of his enemies. The King sent a cold reply,
advising him to attend to the duties of his diocese and
to remain within its bounds till further orders.</p>

<p>Marie de Médicis was passionately angry, and wrote
furious letters to her son and the favourite. It was treating
her not like a mother, but like a slave, she said, thus to
affront her by removing her most capable servant. But
her bitter complaints were of no avail.</p>

<p>Richelieu resigned himself in a more dignified fashion.
Every action of his life must be considered in view of the
fact that he was a politician of extraordinary cleverness,
with clear eyes fixed unchangeably on the future of power
which he always meant to attain. For five months, under
most troublesome circumstances, he had practically ruled
France. He had built his castle eagerly, swiftly, successfully;
and then a far less clever man, by whispering into
the ready ear of a boy, had shaken it to the ground. It
had been built, of course, on the wrong foundation: the
Bishop of Luçon had plenty of time to reflect, as he sat
among his books at Coussay, on the too late realised truth
that divinity hedged a king, that Louis XIII. was the
master.</p>

<p>It is doing Richelieu no injustice to suggest that if he
had been well received in the King’s Council-chamber on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
that tragic April 24, he might never have followed the
Queen-mother to Blois. His sincere admirer, M. Avenel,
says, “His first thoughts were given to the Court and
the Ministry; only his second to exile and the Queen:
ambitious by temperament, generous from necessity, the
seeming heroism of his fidelity in misfortune reduces
itself to this.”</p>

<p>And that very semblance of heroic fidelity was probably
based on the calculation that Marie de Médicis, being the
King’s mother and a person not easily crushed or ignored,
would be reconciled to her son before many months had
passed by. That Richelieu had any real feeling for her
beyond the banal devotion of a courtier seems exceedingly
doubtful. He was a hard creature, made of steel and
flame, and Marie, a dozen years older than himself, was
not an attractive woman. The hasty retreat from Blois
was no personal grief to him.</p>

<p>In short, Richelieu now set himself to please—or rather,
not to displease—Louis XIII., on whose favour his fortunes
so clearly depended. His faith in the future never really
deserted him, though for seven years, like Jacob, he served
and waited in the wilderness.</p>

<p>During that first summer, at his pleasant priory of
Coussay, he wrote a book.</p>

<p>The worthy Père Cotton, the Jesuit confessor of
Henry IV. and Louis XIII., had been dismissed by Luynes.
His successor, the Père Arnoux, a much less discreet
personage, preached a violent sermon before the King
against the Protestants, accusing them of misunderstanding
and misinterpreting the Bible. Four ministers of Charenton,
learned men, published a spirited reply, which was
suppressed by royal order, after discussions in the Sorbonne
and the Parliament. But the Huguenots boasted loudly
that the Catholics could not defend themselves, and it
appeared to the Bishop of Luçon that indeed the Church
had supplied no remedy to save souls from the evil effects
of reading “that pernicious book.”</p>

<p>“Therefore,” he says, “I employed the leisure of my
solitude in answering it; and owing to the length of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
time during which I had been diverted from the exercise
of my profession, I laboured with such ardour that in six
weeks I finished the work.”</p>

<p>This Defence of the Catholic Faith was a book of 250
pages, full of theological learning, and written with
moderation, tact, and practical good sense. The Bishop
here preached again those doctrines of toleration, of conversion
by reasoning, not by force, with which he had
met the Huguenots of his diocese ten years before. It
was the book of a statesman as much as of a theologian.
He marshalled an army of arguments to prove the ministers
in the wrong; enjoined on the schismatics loyalty and
obedience to the laws; but for the King he advised
gentleness and patience; the object to be sought by all
being national unity and peace. The book was printed
at Poitiers, and published within three months of its
beginning. It was greatly admired, and added much to
its author’s reputation; but also, as he notes rather sadly,
“it burdened me with envy.” His enemies saw that they
had not silenced the Bishop of Luçon by banishing him
to his diocese.</p>

<p>There, during these months of enforced residence, he
seems to have worked with all the freshness and “ardour”
consequent on absence and change of thoughts. He writes
in August to the Nuncio: “I am here in my diocese,
where I try to make known by all my actions that I have
and shall have no other passion than doing all I can for
the glory of God.” A word of personal complaint in his
letters is rare. He was surrounded by his friends, living
in a pleasant and healthy little château where the people
loved him. Sébastien Bouthillier was now Dean of Luçon
and his constant companion. He had his books, collected
in the days when he, La Rocheposay, Saint-Cyran and
the rest found their diversion in study; and if all these
things were not the passion of his life, yet he loved them
still. He might have been far more of a bookworm than
he really was, from the tone of his letters at this time.
“I live at a little hermitage among books” ... “I am
living quietly here in the enjoyment of my books” ...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
“Serving God and my friends, I am resolved to spend
the time quietly among my books and my neighbours;”
and much more of the same kind. Now and then, it is
true, when news from the great outside world comes to
him, sitting helpless in his hermitage, he is seized with
restless impatience and confesses himself <i>malheureux</i>. But
this is only in letters to his own family and to his friend
Père Joseph: the face turned to the King and to all
public personages is dignified, grave and serene.</p>

<p>Richelieu watched, from distance and obscurity, the
still rising fortunes of the Duc de Luynes. The lucky
Provençal, of doubtful nobility, was able to choose a wife
among the noblest, richest and most beautiful women in
France. He refused Mademoiselle de Vendôme, Henry IV.’s
daughter—who afterwards married the Duc d’Elbeuf—probably
from fear and dislike of her odious brother. He
would have nothing to say to Mademoiselle d’Ailly and
her enormous fortune, but arranged a marriage for her
with his younger brother Cadenet, a dashing soldier, who
took the title of Duc de Chaulnes from one of her estates.
His own choice fell on Marie de Rohan, daughter of the
Duc de Montbazon, then a lovely wild girl of seventeen.
After his death she married the Duc de Chevreuse, a
younger brother of the Duc de Guise, and was for years
the most admired beauty and most mischievous woman
in Europe.</p>

<p>Another piece of news was the removal of the Prince de
Condé, “ce petit brouillon,” whom Luynes had not dared
to set free, from the Bastille to the Château de Vincennes.
His wife, Charlotte de Montmorency, was now allowed to
share his imprisonment, and the consequence was the birth
of Princess Anne-Geneviève de Bourbon, afterwards the
famous Madame de Longueville. Louis de Bourbon, the
great Condé, was not born till after his father’s release.</p>

<p>Later in the year, the Duc de Villeroy died at seventy-four.
He was one of the best of those old Ministers of
State whom Henry IV. left to his widow, the Regent. The
Pope’s Nuncio, Bentivoglio, had a high opinion of him.
“Great was his experience, great his integrity; ... a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
good Frenchman and a good Catholic,” says the Italian
diplomat. Richelieu describes him as a sincere man of
good judgment, but narrow-minded and jealous, and adds
that he died after fifty-one years’ service with clean hands,
possessing little more than he had inherited from his fore-fathers.
It was a fine testimonial to Villeroy from the
young rival who, if only for a few months, had thrown him
into the shade.</p>

<p>Richelieu was less generous with regard to Jacques-Auguste
de Thou, the “faithful and austere,” “light of
France” and “prince of historians,” as Camden called him,
who died in that same year. Richelieu observes of him
that his piety was not equal to his learning, that knowledge
and action are different things, and that the speculative
science of government needs certain qualities of mind not
always found to match it. The inwardness of this criticism
lies in the fact that de Thou, in his Latin History of the sixteenth
century, made certain scornful and severe remarks on
Richelieu’s ancestors and the part they took in the Wars of
Religion. Richelieu, exceedingly sensitive as to the honour
of his family, never forgave this, and when in 1642 François-Auguste
de Thou lost his head in the Cinq-Mars catastrophe,
it was currently believed that the Cardinal might
have spared him but for those paragraphs in his father’s
history.</p>

<p>In November 1617 Nicole du Plessis-Richelieu, the
Bishop’s younger sister, was married quietly in Paris to
a distinguished but eccentric Angevin noble, the Marquis
de Maillé-Brézé. Nicole was now a woman of thirty. She
had lived at Richelieu until her mother’s death; her portion
cannot have been large; of her brothers, one was a more
or less struggling courtier, one a monk, one a politician out
of office. She possessed little beyond a singular beauty
and charm; the Marquis de Brézé, who married her for
love, cannot have foreknown the brilliant thing he was
doing. Brother-in-law to the most powerful man in Europe,
father-in-law of the great Condé, Marshal of France,
governor of Anjou, Viceroy of Catalonia, the Marquis
had everything; and, “extravagant” as he was, cared most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
of all for a good dog and a new book. But the marriage
turned out unhappily. Nicole de Richelieu went out of her
mind—one of her mad fancies being that she was made of
glass—and died shut up in the castle of Saumur. M. de
Brézé was a bad husband, though a clever and accomplished
man. According to the stories of the time, it was his unkindness
and brutal infidelity that upset poor Nicole’s weak
brain.</p>

<p>The Bishop, of course, was not present at his sister’s
marriage; but he appears to have made all the necessary
arrangements with M. de Brézé, leaving the actual ceremony
to be managed by Henry de Richelieu and his young
wife.</p>

<p>The Duc de Luynes was nervous on his lonely pinnacle
of power. The presence of the Queen-mother at Blois was
a constant anxiety to him; she was not only, in his eyes, an
enemy to the State, but his own personal and unforgiving
enemy. And more than the Queen-mother he feared her
friends; certain of the great nobles, who were already
beginning to resent his exaltation, and those former ministers
who had been the real strength of her rule. Barbin
was still in the Bastille. With an appearance of leniency,
Luynes made his imprisonment easier and winked at a
correspondence between him and the Queen. Copies of
every letter came into the hands of Luynes. Marie’s
messengers boasted of their mistress’s new freedom and
speedy return to the Court.</p>

<p>These intrigues, dangerous from Luynes’ point of view,
came to a sudden end. Barbin, strictly imprisoned, nearly
lost his head; many arrests were made; two or three poor
creatures who had written pamphlets on the Queen’s side
were cruelly put to death; Marie’s own imprisonment was
made much more rigorous, royal guards and royal spies
with new and strict orders being set to watch the Château
de Blois.</p>

<p>Thus setting himself to terrorise the Queen-mother and
her friends, Luynes did not forget the Bishop of Luçon.
On Wednesday in Holy Week, 1618, Richelieu received a
letter from the King full of vague accusations of “goings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
and comings and secret proceedings which caused umbrage
and suspicion, affecting the King’s service and the tranquillity
of his subjects,” ordering him to retire immediately
to Avignon, there to remain till further commands.</p>

<p>“I was not surprised at receiving this despatch,” he says
in his <i>Memoirs</i>, “having always expected unjust, barbarous
and unreasonable treatment from the cowards who governed
us.... But as I was accused of acting against His Majesty’s
service, I humbly begged him to send some dispassionate
person to examine the facts on the spot, being sure that
by such means His Majesty would be convinced of my
innocence.”</p>

<p>It does not appear indeed that Richelieu had been
much concerned, if at all, in the recent intrigues between
Blois and Paris. But Luynes was afraid of him; and
he was forced to depart instantly for that exile which
was the saddest experience of his younger life—proving
once more the old truth that the night is darkest before
the dawn.</p>

<p>He left Luçon on Good Friday, for the royal commands
admitted of no delay, and started on the long, difficult,
cross-country journey from Poitou to the Venaissin. In
wind-swept Avignon, still a half-Italian city belonging to
the Pope, he hired a house and settled himself to endure
the cruel idleness of banishment. He was not alone. His
brother and brother-in-law, M. de Richelieu and M. du
Pont-de-Courlay, shared his exile, for they too were old
adherents of the Queen-mother, and Luynes feared them
all. He shut up his captive birds in the same cage—“a
great consolation to us,” says the Bishop, “though it was
not done for that end, but in order to keep us in sight
together.”</p>

<p>Once more he flung himself into hard study. He wrote
or dictated a large collection of fragmentary notes, which
took the form of a kind of apology or explanation of
his political views and doings. He wrote a religious
book, <i>L’Instruction du Chrétien</i>, planned long before. He
seems to have led a solitary and studious life, seeing few
people, writing few letters except to his diocese, meditating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
much and suffering much, for he was ill in body as
in mind.</p>

<p>And in the autumn the gloom of exile was deepened by
severe family sorrows. The young Marquise de Richelieu,
Marguerite Guiot des Charmeaux, whom her husband had
been obliged to leave behind, died at Richelieu after the
birth of her first child. The little boy, François Louis,
only lived a few weeks, and was then laid in the vault
at Braye with his mother and his ancestors. It was not
long before Henry de Richelieu himself joined that company.</p>

<p>He was terribly grieved and desolate. Every glimpse
that we have of his wife shows her good and charming,
and the blows of fortune may well have seemed to both
brothers too heavy to bear. The child’s death meant the
extinction of the direct male line of du Plessis-Richelieu.</p>

<p>After some weeks, by the intervention of their old friend
Bassompierre, the Marquis and his brother-in-law M. du
Pont-de-Courlay were allowed to go to Richelieu and to
Paris on their family business. The Bishop remained alone
at Avignon.</p>

<p>His solitude there was of his own choice, for the Vice-Legate
and other dignitaries were ready to make much of
him, and a letter to his brother, written in February 1619,
shows him very sensible of some special kindness. He
commissions M. de Richelieu to buy and to send him the
most beautiful hackney he can find—“mais belle tout-à-fait”—probably
such a gentle, ambling creature as a Vice-Legate
would ride—as well as pieces of choice goldsmith’s
work to hang on watches. His anxiety is that the presents
should be “something conformable to his condition,” for
it is better to give nothing at all than “un maigre présent.”
The Bishop of Luçon, in poverty and exile, had already
the splendid tastes of the Éminentissime.</p>

<p>But in actual fact he was very solitary and intensely sad.
For once in his life he seems to have lost faith in his star,
and as the conviction that he would die in exile gained
strength, he thought a good deal of the poor little diocese
he might never see again. He wrote a curious document,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
a kind of last will, dated February 8, and addressed to the
Chapter of Luçon. After some expressions of sincere
affection, he leaves his body to the Cathedral, “that I may
repose when dead in the same place where, living, I desire
to be....”</p>

<p>“... The place of my sepulture shall be, if you please,
immediately above the singers’ desk, leaving the higher
part of the choir, as more honourable, for those who shall
come after me....</p>

<p>“I leave you also all the silver plate of my chapel,
my ornaments, and hangings of Flemish tapestry, to adorn
the choir, without any condition whatever, trusting to be
helped by your prayers....</p>

<p>“If I could leave you anything more, I would very
willingly do so; my will surpassing my power, my wishes
for you must supply the defect.</p>

<p>“The first benefit I wish you is to live in clear consciousness
of your condition, keeping before your eyes that
this world is but illusion, and that there is no profit or
contentment except in the service of God, who never forsakes
them who serve Him.</p>

<p>“I desire for you a bishop who, equalling me in affection,
may surpass me in all other qualities.... I conjure
him, whoever he may be, to reside with you, to visit his
diocese, to encourage in their duty, by his example and
his teaching, those who have the care of souls under
him, to maintain and augment the seminary founded at
Luçon, to which I leave a thousand <i>livres</i> and my whole
library....”</p>

<p>To this seminary for priests, a favourite foundation
of his, Richelieu had already given the revenues of an
abbey in Poitou. He ends his testament by beseeching the
Chapter to live in the closest union with his successor.</p>

<p>“After this, Sirs, it only remains to conjure you to love
my memory as that of a person who tenderly loves you
and passionately desires your salvation.”</p>

<p>Richelieu’s final farewell to the Luçon Chapter was
written four years later, in less affectionate and more
businesslike terms. He was about to be plunged in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
political whirlpool which swallowed the rest of his life,
when he resigned the see in favour of M. de Bragelogne,
receiving in exchange the Abbey of Notre Dame du Wast
in the diocese of Le Mans, a canonry and prebend at
St. Martin of Tours, and a retiring pension of 6,000 <i>livres</i>.</p>

<p>The town of Blois was asleep in the dark small hours
of February 23, when Queen Marie de Médicis got out
of her window in the Château, climbed or slid down a
hundred and twenty feet of ladders—a really wonderful
feat in a woman of her size and indolence—hurried
through the silent streets to the bridge over the Loire,
got into a coach with two or three attendants and some
boxes of money and jewels, and drove off, first to Loches,
then to Angoulême. When Blois, castle and town, awoke
in the morning, the captive royal bird had flown.</p>

<p>The affair had been arranged, with extraordinary
cleverness and secrecy, by the Abbé Rucellai, one of
those Italians in Marie’s household whose intrigues had
brought about the disgrace of Richelieu. The active
agent was the old Duc d’Épernon.</p>

<p>He had been a courtier of Henry III. and Henry IV.,
and had not yet taken up arms in actual rebellion. It
was he who stood by Marie de Médicis after the death
of Henry, and faced the Parliament with a fierce declaration
of her right to the Regency. She had not been
grateful: the Maréchal d’Ancre took the place in her
court which d’Épernon considered his due. Too proud
for a lower position, he retired to his estates and governments,
which were many, including the town of Metz,
Saintonge, and the Angoumois. The rule of Luynes
was quite as offensive to him as that of Concini had
been, and the plot for the Queen’s escape was welcomed
by one of the boldest, most romantic and adventurous
characters of the century.</p>

<p>When the time drew near, the Duke was at Metz. It
was necessary to gain the Angoumois by a secret dash
across France, beset with so many dangers that the
chroniclers called that ride “le voyage d’Amadis.” His
province successfully reached, the Duke sent two active<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
young men to Blois to manage the actual escape, and
himself waited for the Queen at Loches, then conveying
her to a place of greater safety. She was now free to
make terms with her son or to set France on fire against
him.</p>

<p>The Duc de Luynes heard of Her Majesty’s “sortie”
with amazement and alarm. He had long watched her
uneasily; and his brother afterwards told Richelieu that
he had resolved to take the King to Blois on the pretext
of a friendly visit, but really to convey the Queen-mother
“politely” to Amboise, his own stronghold, where “she
would remain for the future under good and sure guard.”
He knew well that her quarrel with him grew more bitter
with every month of her captivity. During that very
winter he had married her second daughter, Madame
Christine, to the Prince of Piedmont, the Duke of Savoy’s
son, with scarcely the formal courtesy of asking her
consent. Such an insult Marie was not likely to forget.</p>

<p>Once at liberty, she might become the rallying centre
for all the discontented in the kingdom, and Luynes knew
that they were many. He had offended the nobles by
withdrawing various pensions, and had set the great
Protestant party against him by royal decrees, especially
one which aimed at restoring Catholic worship in the
little kingdom of Béarn.</p>

<p>For a few days civil war seemed imminent. The King
and Luynes, both furiously angry, began to raise troops,
and talked of riding off to the west. But Luynes was
not Concini. He was prudent <i>au fond</i>, some say timid,
and no soldier. He began to ask advice from wiser men
in Paris and elsewhere, even from the Duc de Bouillon,
head of the Protestants, and they all with one voice
counselled peace. Besides, the nobles showed no great
eagerness to rebel suddenly against the King by joining
the Queen-mother and d’Épernon, while Marie’s letters
to her son gave a kind of basis for negotiations. It
was resolved to throw the actual blame of the affair on
d’Épernon, and a royal edict at once deprived him of all
his appointments and governments, while ambassadors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
carefully chosen to please the Queen, were sent to her
at Angoulême. It seemed possible that such persuasive
tongues as those of her old favourite the Père de Bérulle
and of the Comte de Béthune, Sully’s more courtly
brother and a devoted servant of Henry IV., might
induce her to accept the terms offered by her son
to renounce the company of rebels against his authority,
and to choose a peaceable residence in some other part
of the kingdom.</p>

<p>There were those in Paris at the moment who did not
wait for the failure of these negotiations to suggest an
even wiser plan. One man in France could manage the
Queen-mother: he was in exile at Avignon. Restore
him to her council; give him authority to mediate between
her and the King; his cleverness and moderation would
soon bring her to a less violent frame of mind, and so
arrange matters to the King’s satisfaction.</p>

<p>The originators of this idea were Richelieu’s two
faithful friends, the Dean of Luçon and Père Joseph.</p>

<p>The wonderful friar had been much away from France
during Richelieu’s exile. He had been to Rome and to
Spain, travelling mostly on foot, as the rule of his Order
required. He had been working hard on the details of
a new crusade against the Turks, with the object not
only of rescuing the Holy Places, but of driving Islam
out of Europe. It was the favourite dream of Joseph’s
life. He worked at its realisation in concert with the
Duc de Nevers, Charles de Gonzague, who was descended,
through his mother, from the Christian emperors of the
East. These two, with the Pope’s sanction, founded a
crusading order of chivalry, “La Milice Chrétienne,” and
before the Thirty Years War broke out their scheme
had become popular throughout Catholic Europe. But
it was an anachronism, a mediæval romance, and as
such it soon died away. The two camps of Christendom
had each other to fight. The revolt of the Bohemian
Protestants sealed the fate of Constantinople and Palestine.</p>

<p>Père Joseph’s crusading ardour was equalled by his
devotion to Richelieu. He and Bouthillier worked so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
well on the minds of Luynes and of the King that it
was decided to recall the Bishop from his exile and to
send him to join the Queen-mother at Angoulême, with
the understanding that while faithfully serving Her
Majesty he would counsel nothing against the King’s
interest and the nation’s welfare. The letter of recall
was written by Louis XIII.’s own hand, and was conveyed
to Avignon by M. du Tremblay, Père Joseph’s
brother. Riding post-haste, he arrived there on March 7,
1619.</p>

<p>Here Richelieu may tell his own story.</p>

<p>“As soon as I had received His Majesty’s despatch,
though the weather was extraordinarily bad, the snow deep
and the cold extreme, I posted away from Avignon to obey
my orders, led both by inclination and duty. But my haste
was soon interrupted, for in a little wood near Vienne I fell
in with a troop of thirty men of the Sieur d’Alincourt’s
guards, commanded by his captain of the guard, who met
me with arms lowered, saying that they had orders to
arrest me. I begged the captain to show me his powers,
but he was provided with none. He replied to me that he
was executing the orders of the Sieur d’Alincourt, who had
his orders from the King....”</p>

<p>The Bishop’s impatient rage may be imagined. He was
also greatly alarmed, for it was only too possible that the
King might have changed his mind. Resistance was out of
the question. M. du Tremblay rode off to Lyons, where
M. d’Alincourt was governor—he was the son of the Duc
de Villeroy, and had befriended Richelieu in his young
days—in order to find out which of the royal commands
was the latest in date. The Bishop and his servants were
conveyed by the soldiers to Vienne, the stupid captain
treating his prisoner “like a criminal.” A sleepless night
at the inn was made more hideous by bands of men fighting
in the streets; a sham rescue, it seems, was devised by the
captain for the greater credit of himself and his men. No
wonder that the Bishop was exceedingly angry. “I
thought you were ignorant,” said he, “but I now see you
are malicious.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>In the meanwhile, M. du Tremblay had laid the King’s
letter before the governor of Lyons, who perceived that he
had made a mistake. It had arisen from a morsel of gossip
sent him by his son, who was at court when the news of
the Queen’s escape arrived, and to whom the Duc de
Luynes had hurriedly said—“If your father could arrest
the Bishop of Luçon, he would do us a great pleasure.”
Luynes probably forgot the words, spoken before the idea
of making use of the Bishop as a mediator had even been
suggested; but M. d’Alincourt made haste to act upon
them, sending spies to Avignon and cleverly arranging the
enterprise, “which was not a very difficult one,” observes
Richelieu, “there being question only of stopping a man
travelling alone.”</p>

<p>The governor did his best to “change his rigour into
civility.” He sent his coach to meet the Bishop on his way
to Lyons, with a letter to his captain, who was much
astonished and ashamed. Richelieu showed no resentment.
He easily forgave the captain, dined with M. d’Alincourt
at Lyons, and then pursued his journey. Its risks were
not over, for the snow lay deep in the high wild country
between Lyons and Limoges, and the King’s troops, who
were abroad in those parts, pursued the Bishop for some
distance, supposing him to be the Duc d’Épernon’s son,
the Archbishop of Toulouse.</p>

<p>Richelieu arrived at Angoulême on March 27, after a
journey of more than three weeks. It was again Wednesday
in Holy Week. According to his own account he was
not made welcome, except by Madame de Guercheville.
The Duc d’Épernon and his party looked on him with
doubt and suspicion as an emissary of the King. Marie de
Médicis, surrounded by them, hardly dared to show her
feelings of relief and joy.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br><span class="small">1619-1622</span></h3></div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The Treaty of Angoulême—The death of Henry de Richelieu—The
meeting at Couzières—The Queen-mother at Angers—Richelieu’s influence
for peace—The Battle of the Ponts-de-Cé—Intrigues of the Duc de Luynes—Marriage
of Richelieu’s niece—The campaigns in Béarn and Languedoc—The
death of Luynes—The Bishop of Luçon becomes a Cardinal.</p>
</div>

<p>Neither the Duc d’Épernon’s haughty reserve nor
the Abbé Rucellai’s malignant dislike and envy
could long affect Richelieu’s place among the
Queen-mother’s counsellors. The Treaty of Angoulême
was his work, in concert with the King’s ambassadors,
Bérulle, Béthune, the Cardinal de la Rochefoucauld, and
last, not least, Père Joseph. On both sides the past was
to be forgotten; Marie was to live where she chose and
to dispose freely of her revenues; all her partisans were
restored to the places and honours of which royal edicts
had deprived them. On the other hand, she gave up
the government of Normandy for the smaller one of Anjou,
with 600,000 crowns in money, and the Duc d’Épernon was
obliged to renounce Boulogne, for which he received an
indemnity of 50,000 crowns. It was thought that the
Queen and her party had the best of the bargain, and
every one, even the Duc d’Épernon, gave the Bishop of
Luçon credit for the compromise. He had still bitter
enemies among the Queen’s <i>entourage</i>, but he had also
firm friends, and the best of these was his brother Henry,
distinguished alike as soldier and courtier, on whom the
Queen immediately bestowed the military government of
her chief town and castle of Angers. She thus gravely
displeased her more greedy and restless servants, men
who preferred active rebellion with its chances to peace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
and loyalty. The Abbé Rucellai was leader among them,
and the Marquis de Thémines, captain of the Queen’s
guard, was one of the most ambitious. Various insulting
remarks made by him came to the ears of the Marquis de
Richelieu; the consequence was a duel, in which Henry
de Richelieu fell, stabbed to the heart.</p>

<p>“Death took him,” writes his brother, “but not so
suddenly but that the Sieur de Bérulle, who chanced to
be passing by, had time to give him absolution.”</p>

<p>It was the sharpest grief that ever touched Richelieu.
The two had been much drawn together of late years,
and they seemed at this very time to be starting together
on a fresh and brilliant career.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Thémines disappeared in disgrace
from the Queen’s circle, but others of his party were ready
to snatch at the government of Angers and the command
of the guards. They were disappointed. Marie de Médicis
replaced the dead Richelieu by his uncle, Amador de la
Porte, Commander of the Order of Malta, the worthy
and gallant man to whom young Armand de Richelieu
owed his early education as collegian and cadet. The
captaincy of the guard was given to the Marquis de Brézé,
whose son Armand, afterwards Duc de Fronsac, was born
about this time.</p>

<p>Rucellai and his partisans, seeing themselves out-generalled,
vanished one by one and left a clear field to
the Bishop of Luçon, whose commanding influence grew
every day stronger with the Queen.</p>

<p>A meeting and formal reconciliation between herself
and her son became now the question of the moment. In
preparation either for this or for the chance of civil war
the Court had already moved from Paris, with a strong
escort of troops, to the Loire. The first stopping-place
was Amboise, where the King received news that the
treaty had been concluded. At Angoulême bonfires blazed
and a <i>Te Deum</i> was sung; at Tours, where the Court
proceeded to establish itself for the summer, things were
taken more quietly, perhaps more cynically, for the royal
interview was put off from month to month, and Luynes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
found that he had a formidable person to deal with in
the Queen’s chief counsellor. Though the treaty might
be signed, there were further arrangements to be made
before Richelieu would allow his royal mistress to meet
her son.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile there was going and coming between
Tours and Angoulême, where the Prince of Piedmont
and his young wife, with his brother, Prince Thomas of
Savoy, visited the Queen-mother and were magnificently
received by her loyal friend the Duc d’Épernon.</p>

<p>The long hot summer dragged slowly on. The young
King and Queen, Monsieur (Gaston, Duc d’Orléans, a boy
of eleven), the little Princess Henriette, the Duc de Luynes
and the whole Court, passed the time as best they could
among the woods and rivers of Touraine and Anjou.
They visited La Flèche, where the heart of Henry IV.
lay in the chapel of the Jesuit College founded by him—and
where its ashes are still preserved, the embalmed
heart itself having been burnt by patriots in the Revolution.
They made a progress among stately sun-baked châteaux,
lingering at Le Lude, the owner of which, formerly the
patron of Luynes and his brothers, now held the important
post of governor to Monsieur. Some of the courtiers,
such as Bassompierre, found reasons for riding backwards
and forwards, post-haste, between Tours and Paris. The
Ministers there needed watching, being apt to sell rich
military appointments on their own authority.</p>

<p>At length Richelieu could delay no longer. He had
gained for the Queen-mother some additional advantages
beyond the April treaty, and he had extracted from Luynes
a kind of vague promise, or at least an understanding, that
he should be recommended to the Pope for a Cardinal’s
Hat. At present this was his chief object and desire.</p>

<p>At the end of August Marie de Médicis left Angoulême
to rejoin her son. She was accompanied to the frontier
of the Angoumois by the Duc d’Épernon, from whom she
parted with tears, and she was escorted on her journey
by Hercule de Rohan, Duc de Montbazon, father-in-law
of Luynes, whose château of Couzières, near Tours, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
been chosen for the royal meeting. It was not large or
important, being rather a country-house than a castle; but
its woods and gardens were beautiful, and never, in a
history not lacking in romance, was Couzières the scene
of so much splendour.</p>

<p>The Queen-mother arrived there in the evening, with
her train of ladies and gentlemen, among whom were the
Archbishop of Toulouse and the Bishop of Luçon. The
King left Tours the next morning on horseback, attended
by five hundred princes, lords and gentlemen.</p>

<p>“He arrived at the said Couzières before the Queen-mother
had ordered her dinner; he entered by the park
gate, and the Queen at once came forth to receive him.
She met him in the garden, and there they saluted and
embraced each other with a great appearance of contentment
on both sides; the Queen-mother wept for joy.”</p>

<p>According to tradition, they found little to say to each
other. “My son has grown taller since I saw him,” said
Marie. “For your service, Madame,” said Louis.</p>

<p>They walked together, surrounded by crowds, to the
house, and then, while the Queen dined, Louis strolled in
the garden. Later on, another splendid cavalcade arrived
from Tours—that of the reigning Queen, who “made her
compliments with many demonstrations of joy” and accompanied
the Queen-mother in her coach to Tours, the King
flying his hawks in the open country by the way.</p>

<p>Marie’s visit to the Court at Tours was not a success.
The precedence taken by Anne of Austria offended her.
And Luynes was playing a double game. He wanted the
reconciliation, which would rid him of an independent
adversary; he wanted to work a separation between Marie
and the nobles of her party, especially the powerful Duc
d’Épernon; but he watched with a jealous eye any appearance
of a real understanding between her and the King.
As to her friends and servants, he gave them fair words
and played them false at every turn. His conduct, dishonest
or diplomatic, may be judged by the fact that while
the King was writing to the Pope to request that the Archbishop
of Toulouse and the Bishop of Luçon should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
promoted to be cardinals, Luynes was giving the Court of
Rome to understand, by a secret despatch, that only the
first name mentioned by the King need be taken in earnest.
These “sourdes et déloyales pratiques,” as M. Avenel calls
them, continued for many months, and Richelieu had few
powerful advocates. Cardinal du Perron was dead; and
Cardinal Bentivoglio, the Nuncio, remarked coldly on the
extravagance of the Queen-mother’s demand and “la
sfrenata ambizione di Lusson.”</p>

<p>The Court left Tours on its return to Paris towards the
end of September. The King wished his mother to accompany
him, but she refused, choosing first to take formal
possession of her government of Anjou. Travelling by
way of Chinon, and lingering a few days at the stately
castle on the Vienne, which had been made over to her by
treaty, and was commanded by the Seigneur de Chanteloube,
one of her most violent partisans, she received news which
deepened her displeasure and suspicion with regard to the
Duc de Luynes. Her younger son’s governor, the Comte
du Lude, had died of fever at Tours, and now, without a
word to her, Colonel d’Ornano, a creature of Luynes and
a quite unfit man for the charge, was appointed in his stead.
Another piece of news, sprung upon the Queen-mother
without consultation or formal announcement, was that of
the release of the Prince of Condé, her own and Richelieu’s
enemy, from Vincennes, and his reception by the King,
with a royal declaration blaming those who had brought
about his captivity. This may have been aimed at the
Maréchal d’Ancre, but it struck the Queen. Marie understood
that the first prince of the blood was now to be
played off against herself in Luynes’ game.</p>

<p>She was magnificently received at Angers. The citizens
of that noble old town were as warlike, independent and
keenly political now as in the days of King John, and quite
as unwilling to “open wide their gates” to any unpopular
sovereign. They had been amusing themselves during that
summer by rioting against their excellent bishop, Fouquet
de la Varenne, on some matter of ecclesiastical discipline.
Commander de la Porte, with all his courage and loyalty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
was not quite the man to manage “this peevish town.” He
was a good-tempered chatterbox. Before the Queen’s
entrance into the city, Richelieu wrote a long letter to “my
dear Uncle,” in which, after a number of practical details
as to arms and provisions, he recommended gravity and
dignity in dealing with the <i>bourgeoisie</i>.</p>

<p>All went well on October 16, when Marie took formal
possession of her city of Angers. Thousands of people
received her with immense rejoicings. There was a grand
military display, martial music and ringing of bells, as the
Queen approached, having crossed the long arches and
causeways of the Ponts-de-Cé. She did not lodge in the
gloomy old castle, where Henry II. of England once held
his court, but in the most beautiful house in the town, the
Logis Barrault, now known to travellers as the Museum of
Angers. There a Court soon gathered round her, increasing
in numbers from day to day.</p>

<p>This state of things continued through the winter and
the spring. Over and over again the King invited his
mother to Paris; but she and her intimate counsellors
found little satisfaction in the assurances sent by Luynes
of the royal good-will. The promises went hand in hand
with too many slights and affronts; and though Richelieu,
according to his own account, believed the Queen-mother’s
right place to be at her son’s Court, and though he felt that
his own future lay there, he hesitated to press his opinion
against that of the majority of her friends. He could not
fail to see, as they did, that “there was much to be feared
in the power of the favourites.”</p>

<p>Luynes and his brothers were the first men in France.
As to personal character, though spoilt by success, these
three Provençal adventurers were good fellows enough;
but as to greediness and ambition, Concini himself had not
gone further. In order to be independent of the King’s
favour, Luynes had contrived to get most of the strong
frontier towns of France into his hands. His brothers, one
of them a Marshal of France, married two of the richest
heiresses in the kingdom and took their place among the
highest nobility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>“You would say,” writes Richelieu in his <i>Memoirs</i>,
“that France exists for them alone; that for them she
abounds in all kinds of riches.... The governments and
places that they hold seem in small proportion to those
they consider their due; ... what is not to be had for
money they take by violence; ... for their private bargains
they make use of the money raised from the people for the
public good. In a word, if the whole of France were to be
sold, <i>ils achèteroient la France de la France même</i>.”</p>

<p>Add to all this the insolent, boasting speeches which
came to the Queen-mother’s ears, the complaints of the
King’s own Ministers and of the Parliament of Paris, who
liked the new favourites no better than the old, and the
anger of the nobles who found their pensions unpaid and
the best appointments snatched from their teeth;—it was
not amazing either that Marie hesitated as to leaving her
town and Court in the west to place herself, personally,
in the power of Messieurs de Luynes, or that Richelieu was
slow in advising her to do so.</p>

<p>In May and June 1620 the governors of provinces were
openly showing their discontent. The Duc de Vendôme
could dispose of Brittany, the Duc de Longueville of
Normandy, the Duc de Mayenne of Guyenne; and these
three, with many others, left the Court and retired to their
governments, where they began to prepare for civil war.
The Duc de Rohan, in the name of the Protestant party,
went so far as to advise the Queen-mother to leave Angers
for Bordeaux and to assemble an army in the South. One
of the chief malcontents, the Comtesse de Soissons, furious
at the release of her cousin and enemy, the Prince de
Condé, left Paris with her young son and came to Angers.
As the summer advanced, the Queen having decided to
hold her own in the west, many of <i>les grands</i> followed
Madame la Comtesse, and Marie was surrounded by a
crowd of restless, warlike nobles and princes, who were
held back with difficulty from declaring open and instant
war upon the King. Half France, apparently, was on her
side—princes, populations, Catholics, Huguenots, and men
of law: at one moment a successful campaign against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
King and Luynes seemed a certainty, and Angers was the
centre of enthusiastic military preparations.</p>

<p>But Richelieu was there—a power behind all the discontented
swaggerers of Her Majesty’s Court. A small,
strong party, including the Queen herself, believed in him.
He had taken care that his friends should hold the places
nearest to her: Claude Bouthillier, brother of his faithful
Sébastien, was at this time her secretary. The clergy, who
always influenced Marie de Médicis, were with him to a
man.</p>

<p>He did not intend that the misunderstandings between
the Queen-mother and the King, hardly mended by the
passing reconciliation at Couzières, should come to actual
war. It was he who prevented the move to the South;
he who, through all these months at Angers, carried on
negotiations with Luynes. Now, as always, he resented
the domination of the princes and nobles, remaining convinced
that the King must, in the last resort, be the chief
authority in the kingdom. He deeply distrusted Luynes,
and not altogether for personal reasons of disappointed
ambition. In a sense he stood between the two parties;
he did not cease to be something of a mediator; his advice
to Marie de Médicis was never that of a political firebrand.
Still, surrounded by firebrands—Vendôme and his like—it
was difficult for the wisest counsels to prevail, and Richelieu
seems to have accepted the inevitable, hoping that the
warlike show made by the Queen’s friends might so far
impress the King as to incline him to listen to the serious
complaints poured into his ears by her and by them.</p>

<p>The effect was not precisely this, but Richelieu was in
one way content: it was not the Queen-mother who declared
war. Louis XIII. himself, egged on, not by Luynes,
who doubted and hesitated, but by the Prince de Condé,
decided suddenly to march into Normandy and to crush
his enemies by armed force.</p>

<p>“I will not stay in Paris,” he said, “to see my kingdom
made a prey and my faithful servants oppressed.... My
conscience accuses me of no want of piety with regard to
the Queen my mother, justice with regard to my people,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
kind deeds with regard to the nobles of my kingdom.
Therefore, <i>allons!</i>”</p>

<p>The words had a ring of Henry IV., and they were
justified by the event. With a small army the King swept
Normandy. Rouen and Caen made no resistance; the
Duc de Longueville and the Grand Prieur de Vendôme
fled before their royal master. The first week in August
found the King on Angevin soil; on the 7th he was within
two miles of Angers, on high ground commanding the road
between the city and the Loire. Angers was to his right;
the village and bridges of the Ponts-de-Cé to his left.</p>

<p>For a month, ever since the King left Paris, confusion
had reigned at Angers. Negotiations had gone on
furiously, for neither Louis XIII. nor Luynes wished to
come to actual blows with the Queen-mother. Richelieu,
in public and private, had done his best; in July, preaching
before the Queen and her Court, he warned her that no
faithful subject could advise her to rebel against her son,
and begged her to consider that no arms could triumph
over an angel-guarded King. But all this was of no avail.
With hurry and rashness inconceivable, considering that
neither d’Épernon, Rohan, nor Mayenne had marched to join
them, the warlike party at Angers prepared for resistance.</p>

<p>Marie had a poor set of officers. The Comte de
Soissons, supposed to be in command, was a boy of
eighteen; he had courage in plenty, but no experience.
The Duc de Vendôme was a clever, blustering coward;
the Duc de Nemours a courageous fool; the Maréchal de
Bois-Dauphin was too old for fighting. Louis de Marillac,
afterwards a Marshal of France with a tragic history, did
more than any of them; but he also talked more, and his
plan for the defence was a foolish one. He and Vendôme
attempted to fortify the whole length of the road, about
two miles, between Angers and the Ponts-de-Cé, by an
entrenchment which, according to Richelieu, would have
needed twenty thousand men to defend it. He gave his
opinion freely, but soldiers were not going to be advised
by a churchman, and “nothing could divert them from
their enterprise.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>The sketchy fortification was not even finished, when
the King’s troops swooped down to the attack. His
infantry fought in the flat meadows, under cover of the
lines of hedgerow trees; his cavalry plunged into the
Loire, a shorter way of reaching the bridges and the little
old castle that defended them. Once the passage of the
Loire was in the King’s hands, the Queen-mother’s retreat
would be cut off and she would be separated from her
partisans in the south country: this was why the King,
advised by Condé, did not make a direct attack on the town.</p>

<p>The battle had hardly begun when the Duc de Retz,
one of the Queen’s commanders, seized with the idea that
some treacherous negotiations were going on in the background,
threw up her cause and rode off the field with
1500 men. The rest of the little army, about 2500 men
against 14,000, kept up an uncertain struggle along the
road and the bridges through some sweltering hours of the
August day. A few hundred lives were lost, and it was not
till evening that the royal army found itself in possession
of the river branches and the little town of Ponts-de-Cé.
Even then the wounded governor of the castle, M. de
Bethancourt, held out there till the next morning with a
garrison of ten men.</p>

<p>Few of the Queen’s officers showed such a spirit.
Long before the battle or rout was over, César, Duc de
Vendôme, son of Henry IV., came galloping back into
Angers with the news that all was lost.</p>

<p>“He entered her presence,” says Richelieu, “<i>avec un
épouvantement épouvantable</i>, saying, ‘Madame, I wish I were
dead.’ On which one of her ladies, who did not lack wit
replied, <i>fort à propos</i>, ‘If that be really your wish you
should have stayed where you were....’ The Duc de
Vendôme was promptly followed by all the other chiefs,
except the Comte de Saint-Aignan, who was taken
prisoner.”</p>

<p>So ended “la drôlerie des Ponts-de-Cé,” as the wags
called it. Now was the time for the peacemakers. After
a few distracted hours, during which, says Richelieu, “fear
was absolutely mistress of all hearts and reason had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
place,” a treaty, quite amazingly favourable to the Queen-mother,
was drawn up by himself and the King’s envoys.</p>

<p>He must have wondered at the success of his own
diplomacy. At first, looking round on his terrified party,
on the helpless city with a royal army at her gates, he had
advised Marie de Médicis to pack up her jewels and ride
off by night with a few hundred light horse, fording the
Loire and gaining the free country beyond, where she
might make her own terms with her enemies. But the
unexpected moderation of the King and Luynes made
everything easy. The treaty of Angoulême was confirmed;
the Queen’s partisans were amnestied; the Ponts-de-Cé
with their defences were restored to her; her debts were
paid; she had full liberty to live where she pleased, so long
as she remained in good understanding with the King and
his Ministers.</p>

<p>All this was the work of Richelieu, in concert with
Luynes. The truth was, that the rivalry of these two had
reached a point where it became plain that they were
necessary to each other. Luynes knew, or fancied, that the
King was getting beyond his authority: the dismal boy
had grown into a man and a soldier. The clever and
reckless Prince de Condé made him feel what Luynes never
felt or taught—the charm of war. And he was ready, more
ready than Luynes wished, for a really cordial reconciliation
with his mother. This took place at the old Maréchal
de Cossé’s magnificent Château de Brissac, south of the
Loire, five days after the battle. Marie again wept tears
of joy. “I have you now,” said Louis, “and you shall
never escape me again.”</p>

<p>Detested as he was by the nobles and princes, shadowed
by Condé, threatened by the Queen-mother’s newly rising
influence, Luynes thought it politic to place Richelieu,
as far as possible, definitely on his side. “With great
caresses,” he renewed the promise of a Cardinal’s Hat.
A messenger was sent to Rome with a letter from the
King; and this letter was soon followed by the despatch of
Sébastien Bouthillier, ever faithful—not, as some writers
have represented him, a private envoy from Richelieu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
himself, but authorised by Louis, ready at this moment
to gratify his mother in every way.</p>

<p>But a thousand intrigues, volumes of letters, promises
made and broken in France and in Italy, still lay between
the Bishop of Luçon and his ambition’s crown. Bouthillier
remained at Rome two years, working hard in the dark.
He was made Bishop of Aire before his patron became
Cardinal, but nothing checked his devoted labour. Old
Paul V. was difficult and obstinate. He had enough
French cardinals: the young Bishop, to whose early consecration
he had half unwillingly consented, had not repaid
him well: as Secretary of State, his attitude towards the
Holy See had been doubtful: he had shown some inclination
of late to ally the Queen-mother with the Huguenots.
And besides all this it was well understood at Rome that
whatever letters, whatever ambassadors, might be sent by
Louis XIII., M. de Luynes was in no hurry.</p>

<p>While continuing his <i>sourdes et déloyales pratiques</i>—no
secret to Richelieu, who endured them with sphinx-like
patience—Luynes did his best to let all men believe him on
the best of terms with the Queen-mother’s chief counsellor.
He suggested the union of their families by a marriage
between his nephew, Antoine de Beauvoir du Roure,
Seigneur de Combalet, and Richelieu’s niece, Marie Magdeleine
Vignerot du Pont-de-Courlay. She was a very
pretty girl of sixteen; he was a coarse, red-faced, awkward
soldier. She was not a willing sacrifice; neither was her
uncle particularly eager; he hesitated long indeed for
several reasons, but the Queen-mother advised him, for
fear of Luynes, to consent, and the marriage was celebrated
in Paris in November, during the Court festivities that
followed the triumphant return of Louis XIII. from his
short campaign against the Protestants of Béarn.</p>

<p>Madame de Combalet’s unwelcome husband did not
annoy her long; he was killed at the siege of Montpellier
in September 1622. The young widow, a girl of independent
spirit, worthy of her mother’s family, at once
resolved that she would not be sacrificed again. She made
a vow—“un peu brusquement,” says Tallemant—that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
would become a Carmelite nun.... “She dressed as
modestly as a <i>dévote</i> of fifty.... She wore a gown of
woollen stuff, and never lifted her eyes. With all this she
was a lady-in-waiting to the Queen-mother and never
stirred from the Court. She was then in the full bloom
of her beauty. This sort of thing lasted a long time.”</p>

<p>It lasted till the supreme power of the Cardinal made
his niece equal to the greatest ladies in France and a
probable match for princes. But Madame de Combalet—better
known as Madame d’Aiguillon—kept her vow so far
as that she never married again.</p>

<p>The campaign against the Protestants of Béarn, undertaken
by Louis XIII. immediately after the battle of the
Ponts-de-Cé, was successful in its object of enforcing the
royal edict of 1617 and restoring Church property, now
held by the Huguenots, to the use of the Catholic clergy.
At the same time, Henry IV.’s independent little kingdom
of Béarn was formally united to the kingdom of France.
All this was done with much noise and little bloodshed. It
amused the King immensely. One game for another, fighting
was better than falconry. Through the darkening days
he galloped back to Paris, and had the additional joy of
arriving before he was expected.</p>

<p>“Louis XIII. arrived on November 7, early in the
morning, accompanied by fifty-four young nobles, riding at
full speed, preceded by four post-masters sounding the
horn. He rode through the city, where he was not expected.
The noise made by his troop woke the citizens,
they ran to the windows, and as soon as the monarch was
recognised there were cries of <i>Vive le Roi</i>. The guard at
the Louvre, seeing an armed troop approach, stood on the
defence. They soon learned that it was the King; the
palace rang with transports of joy; Louis XIII. flew to
embrace his mother and his wife. The day was for him
one of triumph. The shops were shut; they feasted in the
streets and lighted bonfires in the evening.”</p>

<p>But the Huguenot party did not rejoice. “As soon,”
says Richelieu, “as His Majesty had brought Béarn back
to its duty, there was talk of the assembling of Huguenots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
in many parts of the kingdom.” And very swiftly the
matter advanced beyond talk. From the central assembly
at La Rochelle orders went out for the Protestants to rise
in all quarters. In May 1621 Louis XIII. started on a
campaign against them which, first under the influence of
Luynes, then under that of Condé, lasted through the
greater part of two years—a campaign rather of long sieges
than of pitched battles, but costing many distinguished
lives, among them that of the Duc de Mayenne.</p>

<p>At the opening of this campaign, Luynes made himself
Constable of France. He was hardly qualified for the
highest military office in the kingdom, being not only timid
as a soldier, but absolutely ignorant of the science of war.
His career, however, was now nearly at an end. His star
had been for some time waning, and Saint-Simon might
well say that he died at the right moment, for Louis,
“whose eyes were opening,” was beginning to turn against
the man whom he had so heartily admired. “Il fut enfin
frappé des dimensions de ce colosse formé tout-à-coup,”
grown to supreme power in the very moment of Concini’s
fall. He made perilous confidences, from which wise
courtiers fled, calling the Constable “King Luynes,” and
complaining violently of him and his brothers. Luynes
did not, as he believed, know his young King through and
through.</p>

<p>The favourite fell as suddenly as he had risen. Three
days of fever, in a village near the castle of Monheurt,
which the royal army was besieging, carried off the richest
and most powerful man in France. A few days later, the
servants who conveyed him to his own estates for burial
were playing at dice on his coffin while they rested their
horses.</p>

<p>It is not fair to judge Luynes entirely from the point of
view of enemies and rivals, even if one cannot accept the
high praise bestowed on him by his admirers—M. Victor
Cousin for example. From many of the vices of a favourite,
Luynes was free; on the whole, his influence over Louis XIII.
was rather good than bad. He was good-tempered and
affectionate, though spoilt by power and terribly greedy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
Clever, if not courageous, and something of a statesman,
it has been said that he “anticipated in some respects
the future policy of Richelieu.” He certainly saved
the King from being dominated by ambitious princes,
and he did his best to make obedient subjects of the
Huguenots. But while he carried on war in France
against them, their defeats in Germany were aggrandising
Spain and the Empire and destroying that balance of
power which Richelieu was to restore. If Luynes had
been Richelieu, the Thirty Years War might have been
stopped at its beginning.</p>

<p>Richelieu behaved with extraordinary discretion, even
after the favourite had been removed from his path.
Effacing himself in public life, he spent his time in assiduous
attendance on Marie de Médicis, both at Court and in her
excursions into the provinces, during one of which she
paid him a visit at Coussay. To please her, they say, he
learned to play the lute; and scandalous gossips found
pasture in whispered tales as to the relations between the
Queen and her handsome Bishop. All falsehoods, probably;
but in any case, at this date his influence with her
was unbounded, and as far as politics went he used it well
and wisely.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1621-2, when Louis XIII., after the
death of Luynes, turned to his mother with unusual affection,
Richelieu advised the King, through her, to cease
fighting his own Protestant subjects and rather, with arms
or diplomacy, to check the rising, preponderating power of
the House of Hapsburg. The advice was not taken. The
King’s mind was now ruled by the restless Condé and by
the cunning old Chancellor Brûlart de Sillery and his son,
Brûlart de Puisieux. For more than two years longer, the
cowardly policy and the selfish intrigues of men like these
were able to keep Richelieu helpless in the background.
And it was not till eight months after the death of Luynes
that a new Pope, Gregory XV., consented to place the
Bishop of Luçon upon the roll of Cardinals.</p>

de Richelieu First Minister of France.</p>
</div>

<p>On September 5, 1622—Richelieu’s thirty-seventh
birthday—the faithful Sébastien Bouthillier sang
his <i>Nunc Dimittis</i>. Writing from Rome to his
brother, he said: “It seems to me that I now have nothing
more to desire in this world, since M. de Luçon is Cardinal....
Indeed, God must destine him for the continuing of
the great works in which he has already been employed,
since He has raised him to this deserved dignity in spite of
the most powerful impediments.”</p>

<p>The news arrived in France when Louis XIII. was at
Avignon, his troops being engaged in that unlucky siege of
Montpellier which closed his second campaign against the
Protestants. A letter was immediately sent to the Queen-mother,
who had spent the summer at Pougues-les-Eaux
and was on her way to Lyons with her favourite Bishop in
attendance. It reached her at a village on the road called
La Pacaudière; there, she herself announced the news to
Richelieu. From Lyons he started for Avignon, travelling
down the Rhône, to thank the King in person. Three
months later, the whole Court being at Lyons, his cardinal’s
biretta was presented to him by His Majesty with solemn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
ceremony at the Archbishop’s palace. The first thing he
did with the red cap so long desired was to lay it at the
feet of Marie de Médicis. It would always remind him, he
said, that he had vowed to shed his blood in her service.</p>

<p>And now—if one may venture on a quotation from
M. Hanotaux’ vivid pages—“he moves to his right place,
among the great and nobly born. His dignity is but the
finishing touch. He is thirty-seven years old; thin, slender,
hair and beard black, eye clear and piercing, he still has
beauty, if beauty is compatible with an evident, intimidating
superiority. He has the colourless complexion of a man
worn by watching and suffering, gnawed by his own
thoughts. It may with truth be said of him that the blade
wears out the sheath; and indeed, long, slight and flexible,
he is like a sword. He places the cardinal’s red cap on his
triangular head. He wraps himself in flowing folds of
purple. Thus, all red, he enters history, realising the most
complete and powerful image of a ‘cardinal’ that imagination
and art have ever dreamed.”</p>

<p>After this striking picture, it is interesting to read the
impressions of Michelet, whose prejudices, historical and
religious, hardly permitted him to be fair to Richelieu’s
genius, not to mention his character.</p>

<p>Philippe de Champagne’s well-known portrait, painted
at a much later date than 1622, but breathing all the stateliness,
the sense of innate power, which M. Hanotaux so
finely suggests, is the text for Michelet’s famous discourse.
Philippe’s art is so true and so penetrating, he says, that it
answers alike to historical knowledge and to popular
impressions.</p>

<p>“In that grey-bearded, dull-eyed phantom with the
delicate thin hands, history recognises the grandson of
Henry the Third’s provost who shot Guise.” [N.B.—Richelieu
was the Provost’s son, and the Provost did not

<p>“He comes towards you. You are not reassured. The
personage has an air of life. But is it really a man? A
spirit? Yes, certainly an intelligence, firm, clear, luminous
shall I say, or of sinister brilliancy? If he made a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
steps forward, we should be face to face. I have no wish
for it. I fear that strong head means nothing within—no
heart, no bowels. I have seen too much, in my studies of
sorcery, of those evil spirits who will not remain below,
but return, and once again move the world.</p>

<p>“What contrasts in him! So hard, so supple, so entire,
so broken! By what tortures must he have been ground
down, made and unmade, or let us say, <i>désarticulé</i>, to have
become this eminently artificial thing which walks and does
not walk, which advances without apparent sight or sound,
as if gliding over a noiseless carpet ... then, arrived,
overturns all.</p>

<p>“He gazes on you from the depth of his mystery, the
sphinx in the red robe. I dare not say, from the depth of
his knavery. For, contrary to the ancient Sphinx, who
dies if divined, this man seems to say: ‘Quiconque me
devine en mourra.’”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Richelieu was now a Prince of the Church, equal to the
greatest in the land. One of the ends of his “sfrenata
ambizione” was gained, but he still had to wait till the
incapacity of the Ministers of France compelled Louis XIII.,
half willingly, half unwillingly, for he admired the Cardinal’s
talents while he feared his dominating character, to summon
him to supreme political power.</p>

<p>During the twenty months of waiting, Richelieu indulged
the natural tastes for building and collecting which had
been, no doubt, trained and encouraged by Marie de
Médicis, herself so great a lover of art in its more splendid
forms. At this time and a little later he bought several
châteaux at no great distance from Paris—Fleury, near
Fontainebleau; Bois-le-Vicomte, which he afterwards exchanged
with Gaston d’Orléans for Champigny, the
hereditary property of his eldest daughter, the heiress of
Montpensier; Limours, which he sold, after spending large
sums on beautifying it; and Rueil, near Saint-Germain.
This last, when bought by the Cardinal, was merely a
small country-house. He made a magnificent place of it,
with moats and terraces, a beautiful park, and gardens in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
the Italian style which were among the most famous of
the century; cascades, fountains, arches, grottos, and a
population of statues. He was a great buyer of statuary,
with which all his houses and gardens were largely adorned.
He posed as a very considerable patron of art, but his purchases
were not made without economy; the sale of various
ecclesiastical charges did not bring in an unlimited fortune.
Nor was his taste always faultless, even by the pseudo-classical
standard of the time.</p>

<p>In August 1623 he wrote a long letter to his private
secretary, Michel Le Masle, Prior of Les Roches—formerly
his servant at the Collège de Navarre—who had been
sent to Italy on confidential business connected partly
with the Queen-mother’s Florentine affairs, partly with
the election of a new Pope, Urban VIII. Having treated
of these subjects, the Cardinal goes on to private matters
of his own.</p>

<p>“The Sieur Franchine advises me to ask if you can
send me some marble statues and a marble basin; for
he says that, not being real antiques, one can have them
very cheap. I particularly want a statue about three
feet high, and a handsome basin a foot and a half in
diameter, to put on his head. If you have this made to
order the statue must hold it with both hands above his
head. You will remember that, being for a fountain, the
statue and the basin must be pierced.... M. d’Alincourt
five or six months ago had five very cheap statues brought
from Rome. You will inquire into the price of marble,
the charges of sculptors, in order that we may judge, on
your return, whether the work may better be done there
or in France.”</p>

<p>M. des Roches is then directed to find out the cost of
“the following statues, in bronze”:</p>

<p>“A Jupiter six feet high, with the face of the late King,
a crown on his head and a sceptre in his hand, dressed
as Jupiter <i>à l’antique</i>.</p>

<p>“A Juno of the same size, with the face of the Queen,
the eyes slightly turned towards heaven, to which she will
point with one hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>“A god Terminus, nine feet high, made after the
sculptor’s fancy, to be set on a column in the midst of
the garden.</p>

<p>“A Hercules eight or nine feet high, holding up his
club in the air, pierced so that it may throw out water.”</p>

<p>And so forth. In his reply, M. des Roches was bold
enough to question his patron’s taste on several points;
remarking, for instance, that though water might spring
forth from Samson’s jawbone of an ass, it could hardly
do so from the club of Hercules.</p>

<p>Water played a great part in the garden decoration
of those days. Canals, cascades, lakes, fountains glittered
and splashed everywhere; and keen amusement was found
in the various tricks played by unexpected <i>jets d’eau</i>. At
Rueil the Cardinal had a wonderful grotto with a cavern
into which he used to beguile his unlucky guests.</p>

<p>“An infinity of little <i>jets d’eau</i> spring out of the
ground; figures of animals, of every kind, spurt water
on every side; and when one tries to hurry out to escape
all this water, the doors are blockaded by heavy water-falls;
and outside the grotto other spouting figures complete
the soaking of those who have passed through all
this water.”</p>

<p>Such was the delightful humour of the time. And it
was not only ladies and gentlemen, finely dressed, who
were subjected to these little “surprises.” Walls were
painted with marvellous perspectives which deceived the
very birds of the air. They met their death while flying,
as they thought, in the blue firmament of heaven.</p>

<p>Rueil was the Cardinal’s favourite residence outside Paris.
His town house at this time was in the fashionable Place
Royale; two or three years later he moved to the Petit-Luxembourg,
a charming hôtel in the Rue Vaugirard,
close to Marie de Médicis’ new palace. While high in
her favour he had much to do with the artistic decoration
of the Luxembourg. He superintended her financial
affairs, and her builders, painters, furnishers worked to
some extent under his orders. De Brosse, her architect,
was supplied with money by his authority. Rubens,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
who was now painting the magnificent series of pictures
in her honour; Poussin and Philippe de Champagne,
young artists not yet famous, employed in smaller work
about the palace, were dependent on him. We find him
inquiring through M. des Roches if Guido Reni of Bologna,
then at the height of his glory, will come to France for
a couple of years to paint the late King’s battles in a
gallery of the Queen’s new palace. But the Pope and
all the Italian princes were struggling for Guido, and
he did not care at this time to leave his own country.</p>

<p>While Richelieu and the Queen-mother waited and
looked on, <i>se ménageant</i>, as a French writer says, and
amusing themselves with matters of art, the confusion in
State affairs went on deepening. The weakness and
irresolution of the Ministers were destroying, day by day,
French influence in Europe, while the power of Spain
and Austria went on growing. Old allies of France were
biting the dust. The progress of the war in Germany
was against the Protestants; the Elector Palatine, King
of Bohemia, had been driven from his dominions, and
James I., his father-in-law, saw no wiser course than to
bid for the help of Spain by marrying his heir to the
Infanta; it was in this very year 1623 that Prince Charles
and the Duke of Buckingham visited Paris on their way
to Madrid. Such an alliance might have sealed the fate
of France and almost made her a vassal of Spain; she
was indeed approaching that state, in the helpless hands
of Sillery and Puisieux.</p>

<p>At home the Court was full of quarrels and intrigues:
the King, uneasy, discontented, and wilful enough, had
not the wisdom or the character needed to dismiss his
useless Ministers and to put a strong man in their place.
He hunted more desperately than ever, and after a year
or two of <i>rapprochement</i> was again becoming estranged
from Queen Anne, who for her part fell completely under
the influence of the beautiful young widow of Luynes,
appointed by him superintendent of her household. After
the death of Luynes, this appointment was violently disputed
by Madame de Montmorency, widow of the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
Constable, who had formerly held it. Madame de Luynes’
chance of keeping it lay in her second marriage with the
Duc de Chevreuse, which ranged the great House of Guise
on her side. The whole Court, men and women, flung
themselves into this quarrel; duels were fought and bribes
exacted. Finally, the King and the Ministers decided to
suppress the office altogether, to the bitter disappointment
of both parties and the wrath of the young Queen.
The Queen-mother, with her favourite counsellor, and the
Prince de Condé, fallen into disfavour at Court and withdrawn
in his government of Berry, were the persons of
chief importance who stood aloof from the fray, each
watching for some change which might throw political
power into the hands of the Prince or the Cardinal.</p>

<p>Richelieu, for his part, was neither patient nor idle,
and while outwardly absorbed by palaces, pictures, statues,
was working underground with an energy hardly realised
by the men of his own day. He had few confidants. Père
Joseph, as always, knew and understood him best and
admired him most loyally; but Père Joseph was hardly
in sympathy with the instrument chiefly used by Richelieu
at this time—Fancan, the famous pamphleteer.</p>

<p>This strange and clever being was a canon of Saint-Germain-l’Auxerrois.
His family, Langlois by name, had
long been attached to the fortunes of the house of Richelieu,
and his brother was the Cardinal’s own man of business.
The Sieur de Fancan had had a wider experience in the
employment of the Duc de Longueville and of the Comtesse
de Soissons. He had done some diplomatic work, and
had developed bold opinions of his own in matters of
politics and religion, posing as “bon français” in opposition
to Luynes and the Spanish ultra-Catholic trend of affairs.
His Protestant leanings carried him far, according to
the correspondence with Germany and England discovered
after his death.</p>

<p>For several years Fancan was high in Richelieu’s
favour. Unknown, anonymous, brilliant, unscrupulous,
he and one or two others made public opinion in France.
His pamphlets or <i>libelles</i>, in their blue covers, were sold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
by hundreds on the bridges and in the book-shops of Paris.
They attacked the Ministers of the moment in verse or
prose full of ironical fury, personal violence and political
wisdom, coarse, impudent and strong. Either in a direct
or roundabout way they were addressed to the King.
Sometimes France, on her dying bed, held converse with
her ancient heroes; sometimes Henry the Great talked
with the leaders of his time; sometimes unworthy favourites
were gibbeted; sometimes the people cried to their sovereign
in bitter complaint of religious tyranny and civil war, and
boldly offered the counsel for which nobody asked them.</p>

<p>The King, the Ministers, the nobles, the literary men,
the citizens, all read these pamphlets, talked of them, and
did not forget them. Louis was much influenced by them;
they touched his conscience and sense of truth, if they
deepened the gloom in which he followed his hounds in
the Forest of Saint-Germain. In the days of the Brûlarts
and their successor, the Marquis de la Vieuville, while the
affairs of the kingdom were slipping from bad to worse,
the pamphlets not only complained more loudly than ever,
they advised more strongly than ever, and the King knew
well that their advice was good, however unwilling he
might be to take it. They told him that there was one
man in France whose hand ought to be on the helm, a man
who would serve his own country and his own King, not
the interests of a foreign power; a man of high courage,
prudence and incomparable dexterity, as wise as he was
brilliant, ready, like a burning torch, to consume himself
in giving light to the State. This man would be the
saviour of France, renewing the great days of Henry. It
was hardly necessary to name the Cardinal de Richelieu.</p>

<p>Fancan only expressed the minds of all thinking men
French or foreign, private or public, who were independent
of the Ministers and above political jealousy. But while
thus serving France and the Cardinal, he was too careful
to serve himself. He was in fact a secret agent, receiving
pay from both Catholic and Protestant powers, and
successfully cheating them all. The independent game
became dangerous when Richelieu was supreme. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
year 1627 it is noted in the <i>Memoirs</i> that “un nommé
Fancan,” a spy whose business was to betray and ruin
the State, was imprisoned in the Bastille. “All his ends
were evil,” says Richelieu, “and the means he used to
attain them were detestable and wicked. His ordinary
work was the making of <i>libelles</i> in order to decry the
government”(!).</p>

<p>A year later, Fancan died in prison. The whole story
is mysterious; but Richelieu was as quick to rid himself
of a suspected friend as of an open enemy.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1623-4 the Ministry of Sillery and
Puisieux came suddenly to an end. These two men were
followed into retirement by the scorn and hatred of a
public which knew that they had used their power not
only to weaken France in Europe, but to pile up large
fortunes for themselves. The Chancellor was succeeded
immediately by his colleague, M. de la Vieuville, a man
of a bolder spirit and more patriotic views, but too
nervous, irresolute and indiscreet to guide France through
her present difficulties. Fancan, the ill-rewarded, attacked
the new Minister with new pamphlets, accusing him and
his family of appropriating public funds. To do La Vieuville
justice, he began his rule by a very unpopular but necessary
move towards economy in the system of universal pensions.
It must also be remembered in his favour that he advised
Louis XIII. to listen to the general voice and at this
critical time to demand the services of Richelieu.</p>

<p>But neither he nor the King intended to give that
formidable personage any real authority. Louis shrank
in terror from “cet esprit altier et dominateur,” replying
to his mother, when she pressed him to admit her favourite
to the royal Council, in such prophetic words as these—“Madame,
I know him better than you do: he is a man
of immeasurable ambition.” With the idea of utilising
the Cardinal’s talents while keeping him outside power,
La Vieuville invented a new subordinate Council for the
management of foreign affairs, and offered him the presidency.
This did not mean a seat on the King’s Council, or any
independent decision, for, as Richelieu pointed out in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
dry and courteous letter of refusal, any resolution passed
by this new body was liable to be negatived by the King
and his Council. He excused himself on the ground of
ill-health and of lack of recent experience in foreign affairs,
declaring that he preferred a private life to “un si grand
emploi.”</p>

<p>It was not difficult to understand these excuses. What
was to be done with him? The King and La Vieuville
tried to send him as ambassador to Spain, then to Rome;
but he would not go. The Queen-mother obstinately
pressed his claim to be admitted to the Council; she
spared neither her son nor his Minister; she even held
aloof from the Court in her discontent, and it seems that
the fear of another serious breach with her had much
influence with the King.</p>

<p>Towards the end of April, 1624, the complications in
home and foreign affairs increasing every day, the pamphlets
stinging more sharply, public and private voices
waxing louder, La Vieuville found himself forced to advise
the King to admit Richelieu to his Council—and this in
the full consciousness that the Cardinal’s rise must mean
his own fall. Even now he tried, in self-defence, to limit
his new colleague’s power for mischief. He was to sit on
the Council for the purpose of giving his opinion, but
nothing more; he might use the influence, but not the
authority, of a Minister of the Crown. Richelieu swept
this fragile barrier easily away; indeed, from his own
account, he ignored it altogether, and history would have
forgotten it, but for some detailed reports sent from Paris
to his masters by the Florentine ambassador.</p>

<p>The Cardinal’s <i>Memoirs</i>, with his letter to the King,
show him by no means eager to accept the offered place
which had been for so long “his one thought by day, his
one dream by night.” All the intrigues of the affair were
open to him, and if he despised and distrusted La Vieuville
and the rest of the Council, he had little confidence in the
jealous, uncertain temper of the King. Writing to Louis,
he began by frankly acknowledging that God had given
him “some enlightenment and strength of mind.” These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
qualities, however, were rendered unserviceable by extreme
bodily weakness—so much so that he had lately besought
the Queen-mother to relieve him from his light duties as
superintendent of her household. Such indeed were his
infirmities that he could not live without frequent excursions
into the country. He added that he had many
enemies, especially those of the Queen-mother, who would
certainly, on his account, do their best to make mischief
between their Majesties; while he assured the King that
he would rather die than do anything against the welfare
of the State, for which he would shed the last drop of his
blood.</p>

<p>These same enemies would take advantage of the fact
that the Cardinal’s opinion might frequently differ from
that of His Majesty’s other Ministers; for, once on the
Council, he would go his own way as to what he thought
best for the King’s service. He would not be merely an
ornamental figure, set up “to please the public imagination
and to dazzle the eyes of the world,” but an honest statesman
who would advise plainly and act boldly. All this
he wished the King to understand, and underlying all this
was the question—would Louis, as a loyal master, stand
between a faithful servant and those enemies?</p>

<p>If, in spite of all considerations, the King remained in
the same mind, the Cardinal said that he could only obey.
The one condition was that, while working regularly with
the rest of the Council, he must ask to be spared “the
visits and solicitations of private persons,” which, besides
occupying his time uselessly, would complete the ruin of
his health.</p>

<p>It was a proud, straightforward letter. In it Louis XIII.
felt the first strong grasp of the hand which was to hold
and lead him almost to his life’s end.</p>

<p>Richelieu entered the Council on April 26, 1624. His
first act was to demand precedence, as Cardinal, of all the
other Ministers, and this was granted after long arguments;
but he did not reach supreme power till the following
autumn, when La Vieuville’s incapable government ended
in sudden disgrace. Those were dishonest times; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
it seems most probable that Richelieu, while outwardly
friendly to La Vieuville, was not only opposing his uncertain
policy but hastening his fall by the underground work
of Fancan and other paid pamphleteers.</p>

<p>On August 13 the Marquis de la Vieuville carried his
forced resignation to the King at Saint-Germain, was
arrested by the captain of the guard and driven off to
be imprisoned in the castle of Amboise. The government
of France was already in the hands of Cardinal de Richelieu,
and Louis XIII. had accepted the list of Ministers
presented by him. The eighteen years’ career had begun
which changed France, making absolutism possible, bringing
in the Age of Louis XIV. and as a consequence, the
Revolution.</p>

<p>Richelieu wrote to Père Joseph, who had lately been
made Provincial of the Capuchin Order:</p>

<p>“You,” he said, “have been God’s chief agent in bringing
me to this place of honour.... I pray you to hasten
your journey, and to come to me as soon as possible, to
share with me the management of affairs. There are
pressing matters that I can confide to no one else, nor
decide without your opinion. Come then quickly to receive
these proofs of my esteem.”</p>

<p>From this time down to Père Joseph’s death, in 1638,
the two Eminences, the Red and the Grey, were seldom
parted.</p>

<p>Richelieu’s aims—The English alliance—The affair of the Valtelline—The
Huguenot revolt—The marriage of Madame Henriette—The Duke of
Buckingham.</p>

</div>
<p>In the brilliant first chapter of Richelieu’s <i>Testament
Politique</i>, “Succincte Narration de toutes les grandes
Actions du Roi,” written not long before his death, he
reminds Louis XIII. of the circumstances under which he
took office in 1624; when “the Huguenots shared the State
with your Majesty, the great nobles behaved as if they were
not your subjects, and the powerful governors of provinces
as if they were independent sovereigns.... Foreign
alliances were despised, private interests preferred to the
public good; in a word, the dignity of the Royal Majesty
was lowered to such a degree, through the fault of those
who had then the chief management of your affairs, that
it had almost ceased to exist.”</p>

<p>“I promised your Majesty,” he continues, “to use all
my endeavours and all the authority that you might be
pleased to give me, to ruin the Huguenot party, to abase
the pride of the nobles, to bring all your subjects back to
their duty, and to exalt your name to its proper place
among Foreign Nations. I represented that for the attainment
of these happy ends, your entire confidence was
necessary to me.”</p>

<p>The Cardinal had that confidence, without which indeed
he could have done nothing. Experience had taught him
that however low “the Royal Majesty” might have fallen,
it was and would remain the centre of power, the incarnation
of France. He was therefore resolved that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
influence with the King should be personal, as well as
political. He had long and thoroughly studied the strange,
shy, gloomy, conscientious young man of four-and-twenty,
on whom his own fate and that of the nation depended.
He knew that Louis was quite capable of thinking and
judging for himself, and he made full use not only of his
personal magnetism, but of all the clever political argument
which his genius suggested. Louis was convinced—and
the conviction went on deepening with years—that his
own honour and the well-being of his kingdom were safe
in the hands of the new Minister, so frail, keen, brilliant,
and superbly sure of himself. That the King ever came to love
Richelieu is hard to believe, considering all the past,
in spite of affectionate letters; but he certainly admired
and trusted him.</p>

<p>The acceptance of the English marriage for Madame
Henriette Marie of France was Richelieu’s first step in the
way of return to Henry IV.’s foreign policy. The idea of
an English alliance, of course, was not originally his. Long
before Henry’s youngest child was born, a marriage had
been suggested between one of her elder sisters and
Henry, Prince of Wales. At the same time, Louis the
Dauphin was to have been betrothed to Princess Elizabeth,
James the First’s eldest daughter—a strange destiny for the
Protestant heroine, the “Queen of Hearts,” “th’Eclipse
and Glory of her kind!” But Henry’s liking for England
seems to have cooled considerably as time went on, and
his latest political turn, doubtfully and unwillingly made,
was in the direction of the Spanish marriages brought
about by Marie de Médicis. As for Henriette Marie, only
six months old when her father died, he had carelessly
promised her hand to the young son of his cousin the
Comte de Soissons. He would probably have broken this
promise. The Queen-Regent had no scruples in doing so,
to the rage and disappointment of Monsieur le Comte.</p>

<p>The present negotiations in their earlier stages were not
Richelieu’s work. He was not in power in 1620, when
Luynes, a poor diplomatist, tried to turn the mind of the
English King towards an alliance with France rather than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
with Spain; nor in 1623, when the Prince of Wales and
the Duke of Buckingham, those two “venturous knights”
lingering incognito in Paris on their way to Madrid, witnessed
a ballet at the Louvre in which Princess Henriette,
now thirteen years old, was dancing. It was afterwards
said that Charles fell in love with the graceful little lady on
that occasion, so that his failure to capture the Infanta of
Spain troubled him little personally. As to Buckingham,
who with all his faults and frivolities had some of the ideas of
a statesman, he was already inclined to the French alliance,
seeing in it the one means of defending the foreign
Protestants and balancing the power of Spain. Through
the winter of 1623-4, envoys of more or less dignity were
passing between London and Paris, and the marriage was
talked of openly. All this time, no doubt, Richelieu was
in favour of it, and his influence, as the Queen-mother’s
chief adviser, set that way; but long delays dragged
out the affair, even after the coming of the English
Ambassadors Extraordinary, Lord Holland and Lord
Carlisle. The chief difficulty, as with Spain, was the
religious question. La Vieuville’s weakness as to this, in
Richelieu’s opinion, nearly wrecked the negotiations. After
he himself became a Minister in April, there was no more
danger that France would, in Carlisle’s words, “be ridden
with a discreet high hand.” The delays were of Richelieu’s
causing, and the “high hand” was that of France. He
meant to oppose Spain and the Empire and to assist—with
discretion—the German and Dutch Protestants; but he
also meant the Catholic Church to be honoured and protected
in England and triumphant in France. In August,
when he had arrived at supreme power, the English
ambassadors found that there was no more dallying
and giving way. If they wanted the alliance, they must
accept the conditions, and very stringent these were. By
the treaty of November 1624, subject to the Pope’s most
unwillingly granted dispensation, Madame Henriette was
to go to England with an establishment of French Catholics,
including a bishop and twenty-eight priests, and was to
have a “large chapel” in every one of her residences; while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
all imprisoned English Catholics were to be released, all
confiscations of their property reversed, and safety and
toleration assured them for the future. Louis XIII. and
Richelieu had to consent that these last articles should be
secret, since the King of England declared it impossible to
present them to his Parliament.</p>

<p>Another difficult affair that called for Richelieu’s management
was that of the Valtelline.</p>

<p>The Val Tellina, rich in vineyards, through which the
river Adda, descending from its mountain source near
Bormio, runs down its stony bed to fall into the Lake of
Como, had long been a bone of contention for the Powers.
It belonged to the Grison Leagues, old allies of France,
and the first difficulties arose when its Catholic inhabitants
rebelled against the oppressions of their Protestant masters.
This was in 1620. On a Sunday long remembered the
Protestants of the valley were massacred. Then a Spanish
army came up from Milan to stand by the Catholics in their
struggle with the enraged Grisons. The Thirty Years
War was already two years old, and the Val Tellina was
of European importance as the best and almost the only
passage for armies between the Milanese and the Tyrol.
Here the Emperor and the King of Spain could join hands,
much to the disadvantage of the Protestant powers and of
France. Naturally therefore the Spaniards took possession
of the valley and its strongholds, and the Grison Leagues
resisted them in vain.</p>

<p>France interfered, but only in the way of diplomacy.
By the Treaty of Madrid, in 1621, the new Spanish forts
were to be razed and the valley restored to the Grisons,
who promised amnesty and toleration. But this treaty
was not carried into effect. Louis XIII. was too deeply
engaged in fighting his own Protestants to undertake the
defence of Protestants in Switzerland, and France held
aloof under her weak Ministers while the Archduke
Leopold swooped down upon the Grisons and once more
deprived them of the Val Tellina, besides forcing them to
surrender to Austria the Engadine and other districts.</p>

<p>Still France hesitated, and it was only the strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
remonstrances of the Duke of Savoy, the Venetian ambassador,
and the Constable de Lesdiguières—himself a
converted Huguenot—who saw the valley made an armed
highway for the enemies of France, Venice, and Savoy,
that brought Louis to insist on the carrying out of the
Treaty of Madrid. In the winter of 1622-3—Richelieu
being in the background, and advising the King through
Marie de Médicis, to the displeasure of the Brûlarts—the
three Powers made a league to this end, agreeing to raise
an army of forty thousand men.</p>

<p>The valley was too precious to be easily renounced by
Spain, and yet she did not wish to fight France and Savoy.
Philip IV. and his Ministers found a way out by calling
Pope Gregory XV. to the rescue, and the warlike ardour
of France was easily cooled. The Treaty of Madrid was
laid aside, and Louis XIII. consented that the fortresses of
the Valtelline should be placed in the hands of the Pope,
pending their demolition and a new arrangement of the
whole affair. It was understood that the Spaniards and
Austrians would no longer pretend to any rights over the
valley, and that all foreign occupation would cease in three
months’ time.</p>

<p>Nothing of the sort happened. Gregory XV. was
succeeded by Urban VIII. in the summer of 1623. When,
after a long delay, the new Pope invited Spain to fulfil
her engagements, she declined absolutely. The free
passage of the Valtelline for her troops was a military
advantage not to be given up. The Pope did not insist:
the action of surrendering the Valtelline, with its Catholic
population, to the tender mercies of the Protestant Grisons,
seemed to him wicked and impious.</p>

<p>This was the state of things in the autumn of 1624,
when Cardinal de Richelieu came into his own. There
were surprises in store both for the Pope and for Spain.
Philip IV. and his Ministers had little fear of France; the
policy of his royal brother-in-law had as yet been anything
but energetic. Urban VIII. and the rest of the Catholic
world found it hard to believe that a Cardinal would fight
against Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>The Pope was asked, in a polite but peremptory fashion,
either to destroy the fortresses or to deliver them back
to Spain, with whom France would then deal direct; and in
any case to withdraw his troops at once from the valley.
He temporised and negotiated in Spain’s favour. Richelieu’s
patience was soon exhausted. The early winter saw
Switzerland overrun by French troops under the Marquis
de Cœuvres, who drove the Austrians back into the Tyrol,
swooped down by Poschiavo on Tirano, and in a few
weeks’ time had taken all the forts and driven the papal
troops out of the Valtelline.</p>

<p>In the course of the same winter Richelieu took advantage
of a quarrel between the Duke of Savoy and the
Republic of Genoa to support the Duke with an army
under Lesdiguières, aided by a Dutch fleet, in an attack
on Genoese territory. Richelieu had indeed no intention
of conquering Genoa or of strengthening Savoy; but the
Republic was Spain’s richest and most useful ally, and such
an attack could not fail to harass her terribly while she
was losing her position in the Valtelline, and to weaken
her power in Italy.</p>

<p>At this crisis in foreign affairs discontent at home rose
furious, and might have wrecked a smaller man. Richelieu
found himself suddenly beset with a swarm of enemies,
private and public. The campaign in favour of the Swiss
Protestants, the strong opposition to Rome and to Spain,
enraged society and the Church; and while this storm was
only beginning to grumble, the French Huguenots broke
out into sudden, most untimely rebellion.</p>

<p>The Treaty of Montpellier had left them discontented.
Their last war had ended, in the autumn of 1622, with
submissions and renunciations hard to be borne by so
proud and independent a party. If the King was bound
to observe the Edict of Nantes, which assured them
toleration, they, on their side, were forced to dismantle
their fortifications, and to cease from all assemblies not
strictly religious. Two strong places only, La Rochelle
and Montauban, were left in their hands. The Duc de
Rohan, now their chief leader—the old Duc de Bouillon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
died in 1623—was deprived of his provincial governments,
though indemnified by smaller posts and large sums of
money. Also the King promised the destruction of Fort
Louis, built by him to command the entrance to the harbour
of La Rochelle. This last article of the treaty was not
carried out: hence great displeasure in the Protestant camp.</p>

<p>In the eyes of some politicians, notably the Pope’s
Nuncio, the Peace of Montpellier, with its concessions to
rebel subjects, was somewhat disgraceful to the King of
France. Richelieu was of the same opinion, to judge by
his own words. But he was too wise not to let the sleeping
dogs of the kingdom lie. Civil war was at all times the
last thing he desired; and at this moment, with two foreign
campaigns on his hands,—campaigns against the great
enemies of Protestantism—the active disloyalty of the Duc
de Rohan moved him to high indignation.</p>

<p>Writing on January 12, 1625, to M. de la Ville-aux-Clercs,
Ambassador Extraordinary in London—employed,
with the Marquis d’Effiat, in the final arrangements for the
royal marriage—Richelieu says:</p>

<p>“You know how the Huguenots have cut out work for
us, sending ships to sea and seizing the Isle of Ré....
Never was so bad an action as this of the Antichrist brothers,
who, seeing the King at war for the interests and dignity of
the Crown, take up arms to trouble the feast.”</p>

<p>To the French ambassador at Rome—M. de Marquemont,
Archbishop of Lyons and afterwards Cardinal—Richelieu
writes on January 27:</p>

<p>“The news you have heard of the Huguenots is only
too true: incited by the devil or others equally bad, they
have shown their evil will by a surprise entry into the Port
of Blavet, landing with cannon, with which they battered
the fort for two days.... The King has news that, the
whole province hurrying against them, they have already
re-embarked in order to escape, and are carrying off two or
three ships of M. de Nevers, which were in the harbour.”</p>

<p>The “<i>frères antichristi</i>” were Henry Duc de Rohan and
his brother Benjamin, Duc de Soubise. They were the
two actively distinguished leaders who remained to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
Huguenot party: Le Plessis-Mornay was dead; the Duc
de Lesdiguières had changed his religion and become
Constable of France; the Marquis de la Force, a brave and
very provincial old soldier, and Gaspard de Coligny, Duc de
Châtillon, held loyally to the Peace of Montpellier, and each
accepted a Marshal’s bâton from the King; the new Duc
de Bouillon was content to watch events from his north-eastern
citadel of Sedan.</p>

<p>Thus the interior peace of France was largely in the
hands of the brothers Rohan, of whom the younger was a
firebrand, an adventurer, never happy unless employed in
some foolhardy enterprise, though capable, on occasion, of
running away; one of those restless spirits to whom religion
meant opposition to law and authority; the very type of
the fighting Huguenot, robber on land and pirate by sea.
Such men, to whom nothing was sacred, were indeed to
be found under both religious banners, one and all the
opponents of royalty and of Richelieu.</p>

<p>Henry, first Duc de Rohan, was a different kind of
person. A sincere Protestant, he carried out in his life the
stern morality of his creed. He had a genius for war, wrote
brilliantly on tactics, but was a diplomat as well as a soldier,
and those who knew him best saw in that thoughtful
character as much personal ambition as religious conscience.
Both brothers were influenced by their ancestry. They
were descended from the old Kings of Navarre through
Isabeau, daughter of Jean d’Albret; and if the sons of
Henry IV. died childless, which seemed not unlikely, Henry
de Rohan was the next heir to the kingdom of Navarre.
He had been acknowledged as such, in his youth, by
Henry IV. What the Spaniards had left of that kingdom
was now united to the crown of France. Thus the Duke
may very well have seen in himself a possible pretender,
a rival to Condé and the Bourbons, at a dreamed-of moment
when the strongest would win.</p>

<p>And his mother, Catherine de Parthenay-Soubise, was
not the woman to discourage such lifelong fancies in her
sons. Fairy blood, that of the Lusignans, ran in her veins;
“grande rêveuse,” her absence of mind and many oddities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
were the talk of Paris; her favourite vision was that of
the Duc de Nevers and Père Joseph, a crusade against
the Turks. We are told that she was not pleased when
Henry IV., whom she disliked, made her eldest son a Duke,
her husband being the eleventh Viscount of his name.
According to the proud old family motto, that name alone
made its bearer a King’s equal.</p>

<p>Madame de Rohan had more reason to be discontented
at her son’s marriage, arranged by Henry, with Marguerite
de Béthune, daughter of the Duc de Sully, then a mere
child. They were married in the Protestant temple at
Charenton, and the story goes that the famous and waggish
minister Du Moulin asked aloud, when the little girl in her
white frock was led up to him—“Do you present this child
to be baptised?” The white robe of innocence did not
long suit the Duchesse de Rohan, and never had a good
man a worse wife. Very pretty, attractive and clever, she
led a life worthier of the Valois Court than of the fine old
Huguenot houses of Sully and Rohan. Not even Madame
de Chevreuse, herself a Rohan by birth, was more free of
moral restraint. The Duc de Rohan, concerned with greater
matters, seemed superbly unconscious of his wife’s love-affairs,
and turned away coolly from the shocked pastors
who tried to enlighten him. In a political sense, they were
one. Whenever her husband needed her help, Madame
de Rohan sent her lovers to the right-about, plotted for
him, followed him in his campaigns. In the winter of 1625,
when the Duc de Rohan was trying to support his brother’s
naval raid by a revolt in Languedoc, Aubery describes how
“the Duchesse de Rohan his wife acted with no less vigour,
and, as if it were her design to throw terror into vulgar
minds, travelled often by night with torches, in a mourning
coach drawn by eight black horses.”</p>

<p>“Suscités par le diable ou quelques autres qui ne valent
pas mieux.” No doubt the Cardinal had accurate knowledge
of the influences, diabolical or other, which had
brought about the Huguenot rising at this awkward
moment. It was partly the work of the angry people of
La Rochelle, who saw their town perpetually threatened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
by royal forts on land and their harbour watched by royal
ships at sea. They counted on the help of the Protestant
powers, England and Holland, to make a favourable
bargain with the King’s government, already entangled
in the Swiss and Genoese campaigns. And they were
backed up in a quarter which might well have been
unexpected. The money that provided Soubise with
ships came from Spain. Rohan and he, more than once
treating secretly with the enemies of France, may not
have deserved Richelieu’s epithet of “Antichristi,” but
were certainly anti-patriotic.</p>

<p>As the Cardinal wrote to the ambassadors, the Duc
de Soubise, not content with seizing the Isle of Ré and
thus commanding La Rochelle, had sailed north and
pounced on the harbour of Blavet, on the Brittany coast,
at the mouth of the river below Hennebon. The harbour
had been fortified by Louis XIII. in the former civil wars,
and was known as Port Louis. Six battleships were now
lying there, five of which did not belong to the King,
but had been lent him by the Duc de Nevers. Soubise
took the town and the ships—including the famous great
<i>Vierge</i>, of eighty guns—and attacked the castle, which held
out long enough for the Duc de Vendôme, governor of
Brittany, to come to the rescue. Soubise then escaped
to sea, but with difficulty, carrying four of his prizes
with him; and sailing like a bold pirate southward, taking
the island of Oléron as a base for his operations, became
a terror to vessels of war or merchandise all along the
coast. Later on he stormed up the Gironde in support
of the Duc de Rohan, who had already set Guienne and
Languedoc in a blaze.</p>

<p>All this trouble, arising at such an unwelcome moment,
caused terrible agitation among the King’s councillors.
Most of them, says Richelieu, were “si éperdus,” that they
saw no choice but between immediate peace with Spain
and submission to all the Huguenot demands. He himself
would have no such craven yielding to the storm.
With little slackening of energy in the Swiss and Genoese
campaigns, he set to work to crush the revolt at home,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
acting on the medical maxim that a small internal injury
is more to be feared than one greater and more painful,
but external only.</p>

<p>His understanding with England and Holland now
bore some fruit. Their statesmen, less consistent than
their populations, did not refuse to support him against
his rebels, in spite of their religion. England, already
on the edge of war with Spain, sent eight ships to the
help of the French Government; the Dutch fleet was
diverted from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, and
twenty French ships made up a fleet of fifty or sixty
sail, commanded in chief by Duke Henry de Montmorency,
High Admiral of France. Richelieu had not much faith
in this young man, the late Constable’s only son and
the Princesse de Condé’s brother—one of the handsomest
and boldest of the fierce order that the Cardinal
meant to subdue. But as far as Montmorency was concerned
the time of vengeance was not yet. He and the
Dutch Admiral, after a long fight with Soubise on the
sea, scattered his fleet, took the islands of Ré and Oléron,
and came very near to capture La Rochelle itself.</p>

<p>Here Richelieu held his hand. He was not yet ready
for that great siege, or for the final crushing of the
Protestant power in France.</p>

<p>On May 11, when the Huguenot revolt was in full
swing, Princess Henriette, low of stature, with lovely
black eyes and obstinate mouth, was married by proxy
at Notre Dame to the new King of England. A high stage
was set up outside the west doors of the cathedral, and
on this the ceremony was performed, after the pattern
of the wedding of Henry IV. and Marguerite de Valois:
a Protestant prince could not be married within the walls.
Here may have lain some foretaste of sadness for her who
was to be known as <i>la Reine Malheureuse</i>, though she
was ready, with strong religious faith, to accept the almost
missionary character of Queen of a heretic country, an
Esther for her own people. But the tones of warning
were silent that day. She had not even received the
letter in which Marie de Médicis, inspired by the Père<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
de Bérulle—not by Richelieu, though he claims that credit
in his <i>Memoirs</i>—laid down in eloquent sentences the
duties of her new life. For the bride of fifteen all was
joy and festival. King Charles’s proxy was Claude, Duc
de Chevreuse, of royal blood, a younger son of Henry
le Balafré and brother of Charles, Duc de Guise. He was
one of the handsomest and most splendid of Louis XIII.’s
courtiers, and his famous wife, the widow of Luynes,
Queen Anne’s favourite lady, possessed all the magnificent
confiscated jewellery of the unlucky Maréchale d’Ancre.
This gorgeous pair were to escort the young Queen to
England.</p>

<p>After the ceremony, at which the Duc de Chevreuse
acted his part of a Protestant prince to admiration, a royal
banquet was held in the hall of the Archbishop’s palace,
then close to the cathedral.</p>

<p>“There were bonfires in all the streets of Paris,” writes
Richelieu, “and lights in the windows, which turned
night into brilliant day. The Cardinal, who with such
pains and prudence had brought this alliance to a happy
end, feeling obliged to show his contentment, which
exceeded that of all others, presented their Majesties and
the Court with a supper and fireworks which were worthy
of the magnificence of France.”</p>

<p>The Cardinal’s high contentment did not last long. At
the moment there were reasons for it: slight hopes, which
soon faded, of a swift end to the revolt; the arrival of the
Pope’s nephew and legate, Cardinal Barberini, to negotiate
a peaceful settlement of the Valtelline affair. Then all
was upset, in Richelieu’s view, by the descent on Paris
of the Duke of Buckingham.</p>

<p>Ostensibly, that great personage came as his master’s
special representative, to fetch home Charles’s Queen.
In Paris “his Person and Presence was wonderfully
admired and esteemed” ... “he out-shined,” as Lord
Clarendon tells us, “all the bravery that Court could
dress itself in, and over-acted the whole Nation in their
own most peculiar Vanities.”</p>

<p>Cardinal de Richelieu’s “pains and prudence” had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
been in order to the satisfying of this gentleman, who
unluckily ruled both fashion and politics in England, and
he was by no means disposed to make peace or war at
Buckingham’s bidding. For the Duke’s visit was far from
being one of mere courtesy. He had two political ends
in view: first, to defeat the Pope’s legate and to keep
France at war with Spain; second, to make so close an
alliance with France that she would be bound to fight for
the restoration of the Elector Palatine to his dominions.
Richelieu would have none of this state of bondage.
Louis XIII., led by him, stood firm and independent. He
would accept peace with Spain when he judged it advisable,
and he would not throw himself into the war in Germany,
except by allowing Count Mansfeldt, on the Protestant
side, to be reinforced by a couple of thousand French
horse at the expense of those who employed them. This
concession, which does not sound great, was made with
the view of keeping England in a good temper, at least
so long as the King of France had his Huguenot rebels
to contend with.</p>

<p>Buckingham pressed for peace in that direction, but
was answered, with sufficient haughtiness, that in the
interest of the King his master he ought to be silent.
“For no prince,” said Richelieu, “should assist, even by
words, the rebellious subjects of another.”</p>

<p>Buckingham promised, swaggered, threatened a little.
He would send a hundred ships to ravage the coast of
Spain, and would land an army of 15,000 men in Flanders,
if King Louis would supply 6000 cavalry. He would
conquer Artois and make a present of it to France. But
if the French received these offers coldly, England would
seek the friendship of Spain and recover the Palatinate
by treaty.</p>

<p>To which Richelieu replied that it was for the English
to consider whether it would be for their advantage to
send a fleet to Spain and an army to Flanders; that his
King advised them to think well beforehand whether
these would be the best means of recovering the Palatinate.
If the same result could be gained by treaty, he advised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
them to prefer the latter course. As to the polite offer
of Artois, the King of France had no wish for conquests,
and in marrying his sister to the King of England desired
no acquisition but his friendship.</p>

<p>Between the lines of the <i>Memoirs</i> it is easy to read
Richelieu’s scornful dislike of the splendid upstart who
ruled England and tried to play the game of politics
with him; a dislike which deepened into distrust and
uneasiness later, when Buckingham’s cause for quarrel
with the French government had become that of a passionate,
disappointed man rather than that of a politician,
however foolhardy.</p>

<p>The story of Henrietta’s progress to Calais has often
been told; a story in which the interest quite leaves
Charles’s little bride to centre itself round the beautiful
young Queen of France and the love-affair in which
Buckingham, at least, was desperately in earnest. Her
husband’s unkind neglect might have given the Queen
every excuse, even if her dearest friend, Madame de
Chevreuse, had not been a standing example of the morals
favoured by society. It is certain that Anne was strongly
attracted by the great charmer of his age; but religion
and Spanish dignity, not to mention the care of her elder
ladies and the watchfulness of the Court, were a sufficient
protection. Only the most notorious scandal-mongers
dared to hint otherwise.</p>

<p>Lord Clarendon’s very discreet account of the affair
sets forth plainly the political result of Buckingham’s
anger.</p>

<p>“In his Embassy in France ... he had the Ambition
to fix his Eyes upon, and to dedicate his most violent
Affection to, a Lady of a very sublime Quality; Insomuch
as when the King had brought the Queen his Sister as
far as he meant to do, and delivered her into the hands
of the Duke to be by him conducted into England; the
Duke, in his Journey, after the departure of that Court,
took a resolution once more to make a visit to that great
Lady, which he believ’d he might do with much privacy.
But it was so easily discover’d, that provision was made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
for his Reception; and if he had pursued his Attempt,
he had been without doubt Assassinated; of which he
had only so much notice, as serv’d him to decline the
Danger. But he swore, in the instant, ‘that he would See
and Speak with that Lady, in Spight of the Strength
and Power of France.’ And from the time that the Queen
arriv’d in England, he took all the ways he could to
Undervalue and Exasperate that Court and Nation, by
causing all those who fled into England from the justice
and displeasure of that King, to be receiv’d and entertain’d
here, not only with ceremony and security, but with
bounty and magnificence; and the more extraordinary
the Persons were, and the more notorious their King’s
displeasure was towards them (as at that time there were
very many Lords and Ladies in those circumstances) the
more respectfully they were receiv’d, and esteem’d. He
omitted no opportunity to Incense the King against France,
and to dispose him to assist the Hugonots, whom he
likewise encourag’d to give their King some trouble....”</p>

<p>Among these “extraordinary Persons” was the Duc
de Soubise, who fled to the English coast after his defeat
at sea and remained in England, welcome alike to lords
and commons; doing his best the while to shake down
the already tottering friendship between Charles I. and
his royal French brother-in-law.</p>

<p>Peace with Spain—The making of the army and navy—The question of
Monsieur’s marriage—The first great conspiracy—Triumph of Richelieu
and death of Chalais.</p>

</div>
<p>The Duke of Buckingham had to do with a mind
immeasurably superior to his own; and if he, in the
autumn of 1625, was pushing on a quarrel with
France, Cardinal de Richelieu’s game, for the present, was
to disappoint him. The English fleet, playing at piracy,
carried off French merchant ships: English influence led
the Dutch to recall the fleet they had lent to France; a
serious annoyance to Richelieu, who had not yet had time
to make a navy. He had other reasons for being angry
with King Charles, who, from Henrietta’s first arrival in
England, had frankly shown his dislike of the “Monsers”
she brought with her and seemed ready to treat all his
marriage promises, open or secret, as waste paper. But
Richelieu intended England to be the powerful mediator
between Louis XIII. and the Huguenots; to this end, he
ignored a whole series of pin-pricks, invited English
ambassadors to Paris, and let it be understood that France,
once at peace internally, would be ready to give active help
in Germany.</p>

<p>That bleeding wound of civil war had so weakened the
campaign in North Italy as to make it ineffectual. An
Austrian force, pouring down over the Saint-Gothard, had
reinforced Genoa, and Lesdiguières, with no fleet to support
him, had been obliged to retire. But the Spaniards
had failed to recover the Valtelline. It remained for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
present in the hands of the French; a difficult question to
be settled with the Pope, and Cardinal Barberini’s mission
to that end resulted in nothing but words. He went back
to Rome, in high discontent, at the end of September, and
Richelieu, so far from slackening his hold, sent the Maréchal
de Bassompierre to reinforce the Marquis de Cœuvres in
Switzerland. It seemed that there was nothing to be done
in the Catholic interest with “le Roy du Roy,” the man
people already called atheist, Huguenot, “le Cardinal de la
Rochelle.”</p>

<p>This was not quite the case, however. Though Richelieu
would not treat with Cardinal Barberini, he had already
entrusted his other self, Père Joseph, with powers for
negotiating with Urban VIII. at Rome. At the moment,
the mission of Barberini made this impossible, but it seems
that the Capuchin—never publicly mentioned in State
affairs, but always to be found pulling the strings for
Richelieu in the background—passed on his instructions to
the Comte du Fargis, French ambassador at Madrid, who
set to work on the hard task of framing a treaty to please
everybody—Spain, Austria, the Pope, the Grison Leagues
and France—but notably that secret party in France,
headed by the Queen-mother, M. de Marillac, afterwards
Chancellor, and Père de Bérulle, among whom Richelieu’s
opponents were now to be found. M. du Fargis, in his
communications with the Spanish Minister, Count Olivarez,
considered rather the wishes of this French ultra-Catholic
party, reported to him by his brilliant and mischievous
wife, now in Paris, than the intentions of Richelieu. The
consequence was, that several attempts at a treaty were
scornfully repudiated by the French government, and it
was not till May 1626 that any agreement was arrived at.
A nominal sovereignty over the Valtelline was restored
to the Grisons, and Spain renounced any right of passage.
The Catholic religion was established in the valley, and
the forts were restored to the Pope, to be demolished by
his troops. All parties were fairly satisfied, except the
Duke of Savoy, whose quarrel with Genoa was coolly set
aside without any reference to him. And the English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
government, which had almost forced the French Huguenots
to accept an unprofitable peace from Louis XIII.
in February, saw with immense irritation the conclusion of
peace between France and Spain. This was not the end
they had worked for; and the secret diplomacy of Richelieu
was regarded in England as a dishonourable trick.</p>

<p>He cared not at all. Peace was necessary to him at
this time: how necessary, a glance at his home projects
is enough to prove. He now set to work upon them in
earnest; backed up by public opinion, both in 1625 and
1626, in the shape of assemblies of the Notables—princes,
dukes, and peers of France, archbishops and bishops,
crown officers, presidents of courts of law, and the provost
of the merchants of Paris. At these assemblies the chief
personages of the kingdom were invited to advise the King.
Richelieu took care that their advice should accord with
his own, for his day of absolute power was only dawning.
He had his way with them: as a body, they gave their
consent to his policy at home and abroad.</p>

<p>The creation of a navy was his most popular measure.
No longer should the King of France be forced to borrow
ships where he could, to protect French coasts and French
merchant vessels against “pirates of all nations.” Michel
de Marillac, if he had secretly opposed Richelieu in the
affair of the Spanish treaty, was heartily with him here,
and he was one of those whose eloquence led the Notables
to vote with enthusiasm the building or purchase of forty-five
battle-ships. The sea-going trade of France, its enormous
losses and dangers under the present system, was the
text which inspired Marillac.</p>

<p>“We have everything we need,” he cried, “to make us
strong at sea. We have wood and iron for ship-building,
linen and flax for sails and cordage; sailors in abundance,
who will serve our neighbours if not employed at home;
the best ports in Europe ... and yet our neighbours rob
us of our fishing ... pirates ravage our coasts and carry
off the King’s subjects captive to Barbary.”</p>

<p>It was time, he said, that France should wake from
her lethargy of many years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>The words of Marillac on this occasion were the
thoughts of Richelieu, and he set about carrying them out
in his own way. He had already taken to himself supreme
power over naval affairs, by buying out the Duc de Montmorency
and presenting himself with letters patent which
conferred the new office of Grand Master and Superintendent-General
of Navigation and Commerce.</p>

<p>Authority over the army—which he made almost entirely
from small and chaotic beginnings till it became the
force that conquered at Rocroy—was gained by Richelieu
through the abolition of the old office of Constable of
France. The Duc de Lesdiguières, its last holder, died in
1626, and military supremacy under the King passed into
the hands of a War Minister—that is to say, into those of
Richelieu himself.</p>

<p>Equally difficult with the creation of army and navy
were the necessary reforms in the Church, in finance, in
local government, and the establishment throughout France
of order and the royal authority. The Cardinal shrank
from nothing. Many of the details of his projected work
were never carried out, and it has been well said that he
was a more successful statesman abroad than at home,
where a mass of privileges and vested interests, with the
growing necessity for heavy taxes, were millstones hung
round a financial reformer’s neck. Richelieu’s success in
crushing the great nobles brought no benefit to the common
people; it was all for the advantage of the King. Among
his early dreams were those of encouraging agriculture
and manufactures after the example of Henry IV. and
Sully; but he did little good of this kind, except in the
way of colonisation. Under his protection new French
commercial companies, after a long struggle with England,
gained a more secure footing in Canada and the West
Indies.</p>

<p>For the first few years of Richelieu’s ministry he was
working against tremendous odds. His health was terribly
bad. All through the winter of 1625-6 he suffered from
fever and constant headaches, so that he was often forced
to leave Paris in the midst of his work and to fly for rest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
and change to one of his country-houses. Once at least,
when summoned back on public affairs to the Petit-Luxembourg,
he writes to Claude Bouthillier: “I am so
persecuted by my head ... my pain is excessive.... I
am so persecuted by my head, I know not what to say.
But even were I worse, I would rather die than not drag
these important affairs to a conclusion.”</p>

<p>At this very time, in the spring of 1626, the discontent
he had already caused in high quarters began to show its
teeth, and the first of many conspiracies was formed
against him.</p>

<p>He had very few sincere friends except in his own
family, and among the men who worked with him, and
whom he entirely trusted. Marie de Médicis, indeed, had
not yet actually broken with him; they were apparently
on the same terms as before. But in actual fact the
distance between them was widening every day. Influenced
by Bérulle, the Queen-mother had become more
dévote; she disapproved of the long delay in making peace
with Rome and Spain, and of the treaty with the Huguenots,
helped on by the intervention of heretic England.
She was angry with England for other reasons: the presumption
of Buckingham, the treatment of the young
Queen’s French household. All these things were turning
her mind against Richelieu’s policy. And he was not very
diplomatic with regard to his patroness. He showed too
plainly perhaps that her friendship was no longer of the
highest importance to him. He had gained what he
wanted; he was the first man in France, indispensable to
the King. Ill, impatient, overworked, straining every nerve
to keep his hold on affairs and his influence with his royal
master, it was hardly strange that he should fail a little
in grateful attention to a stupid elderly woman, even
though he owed her everything.</p>

<p>But Marie de Médicis was not responsible for this first
great “storm,” as the Cardinal calls it in his Memoirs.
The clouds rolled up round the King’s young brother,
Monsieur, Duc d’Anjou, and were brought to a head by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>Richelieu’s decision that he should marry Mademoiselle de
Montpensier, the only child of the last lord of Champigny
and the present possessor of his enormous wealth.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">GASTON DE FRANCE, DUC D’ORLÉANS</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The plan of this match was nothing new. Henry IV.
and Marie de Médicis had betrothed the heiress to their
son Nicolas, Duc d’Orléans, when both were infants. After
the boy’s early death it was proposed that he should be
replaced by his younger brother, Gaston, but there was no
formal contract. The Queen had never renounced the idea,
specially welcome to her because of her friendship with the
girl’s mother, the Duchesse de Montpensier, afterwards
Duchesse de Guise, and of the warm affection she had
always felt for Mademoiselle de Montpensier herself, who
was now twenty-one, three years older than Gaston, and
of a singularly sweet character.</p>

<p>As to Monsieur, he has been described often enough.
Handsome, intelligent, weak, foolish, restless, impressionable,
gay and agreeable, false and cowardly, he inherited
little of Henry IV. but his vices and frivolities. He had
been ill-trained by his governor, Colonel—now Maréchal—d’Ornano,
the Corsican officer who had won his post by
devotion to Luynes at the time of Concini’s death. Since
those days d’Ornano had owed some gratitude to Cardinal
de Richelieu, and he was now superintendent of his former
pupil’s household. The Cardinal had lately displeased him
by refusing to admit him, with Monsieur, to the royal
Council; and disappointed personal ambition was the chief
cause of his throwing in his lot with those who were bent
on making Monsieur the head of an opposing party in the
State. On the whole, d’Ornano was probably more foolish
than dangerous. Great ladies did what they pleased with
him; and he seems to have confided his dreams of power,
both for his young master and for himself, to no less a
person than Père Joseph, the actual ear of Richelieu.</p>

<p>But the centre of the cyclone was not in Monsieur’s
own household: it was in the heart of the young childless
Queen. Long afterwards Anne of Austria told Madame
de Motteville that she had done all she could to prevent
Monsieur’s marriage with Mademoiselle de Montpensier,
believing that marriage to be entirely against her own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
interests. Already she was neglected enough, unhappy
enough. Louis XIII., if not the worst of husbands, was
sulky, suspicious, resentful. The Queen and her intimate
friends lived in an atmosphere of gloom, almost of persecution,
under the shadow of the King and his Minister.
Louis hated Madame de Chevreuse, and with some reason
if it is true that her wild spirits had led Anne into romping
games which more than once cost France a Dauphin.</p>

<p>But it seemed to the Queen that Gaston’s proposed
marriage made her position hopeless. If he had children,
heirs to the crown, his wife would certainly be regarded as
the first woman in France, and the prospect filled Anne
with jealous misery. Personally, of course, she could do
little in opposition, and the extent of her share in the great
conspiracy was much exaggerated by scandalous tongues
and pens. But Madame de Chevreuse threw herself into her
mistress’s cause with all the more energy because she hated
both Richelieu and the King. The Maréchal d’Ornano’s
discontent found a hearty ally in her, loveliest and most
daring of <i>intrigantes</i>, and also in the Princesse de Condé,
who had her own reasons for disliking the Montpensier
marriage. That younger branch of the Bourbons would
thus be exalted above the branch of Bourbon-Condé,
now next in succession to the crown. If Monsieur must
marry—a troublesome necessity—the Condés wished for
a match between him and their daughter Anne-Geneviève,
now seven years old. The delay would please the Queen;
in the meantime the Prince de Condé was ready to back
Maréchal d’Ornano in demanding honours and appanages
for Monsieur and even a share in the government. The
alternative to the Condé marriage was one with a foreign
princess; in either case the young prince would be independent
of his brother, his mother and Cardinal de Richelieu.
He was as popular, lively and good-natured as the King
was unsociable and forbidding; and under the circumstances
such a “cabale,” as Richelieu calls it, was likely
to spread far.</p>

<p>The Cardinal saw his danger. The greater among the
conspirators were rather scornful of caution and secrecy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
If Richelieu’s knowledge of their objects was at first vague,
hardly a rebel name escaped him. From the Prince de
Condé, still holding aloof from the Court, and the young
Comte de Soissons, who intended himself to marry Mademoiselle
de Montpensier, to César, Duc de Vendôme,
governor of Brittany, who was prepared to make his
province the head-quarters of an insurrection, and his
brother Alexandre, the Grand Prior, with many others of
less high descent but yet among <i>les grands</i>—Richelieu
knew them all. Behind them loomed shadows of foreign
Powers: the Dutch, indignant at the coldness of their ally
and at her treaty with Spain; the English, “from faithlessness
alone”; the Spaniards, from natural enmity and
interested ambition; the Duke of Savoy, to avenge his
wounded pride; and then, of course, the Huguenot party
in France—past experience teaching them, Richelieu says
bitterly, that they always profited by the troubles of the
State.</p>

<p>The ends of the conspiracy revealed themselves with a
certain slowness, reaching the Cardinal through one spy
and another. All through the spring of 1626 the air was
full of dark and threatening rumours. Opposition to the
Montpensier marriage was a mere starting-point. Monsieur
was little but the figure-head of a faction opposed to the
whole of Richelieu’s policy and bent on forcing his fall.
The refusal of Monsieur’s demands was to be the signal
for open revolt, in which the Huguenots would make
common cause with the princes and half the great nobles
of the kingdom. The boldest conspirators talked of killing
the Cardinal, “the dragon who watched unceasingly over
his master’s safety”; of throwing the King into prison, and
in case of his death of marrying Monsieur to the Queen.
It seems certain that Anne herself was unjustly accused of
being even aware of such desperate schemes as these; but
she was never quite cleared from the injurious suspicion.</p>

<p>Early in May, when the Court was at Fontainebleau,
Richelieu decided to strike; he had evidence enough to
convince the King that his brother’s attitude was dangerous.
M. d’Ornano came to wait on His Majesty. Louis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
received him graciously. The same night he was arrested,
and the next night found him a prisoner at the castle of
Vincennes. His brothers and intimate friends were thrown
into the Bastille. “My husband is dead,” said Madame
d’Ornano when she heard of his capture; and the words
were spoken but a few months too soon.</p>

<p>Monsieur was furiously angry. He remonstrated loudly
with the King, who merely answered that he had acted
on the advice of his Council. The Prince then attacked
M. d’Aligre, the Chancellor, a timid personage, who humbly
excused himself, declaring that he had given no advice of
the kind. Gaston went blustering to Richelieu, from whom
he met with a different reception and a different reply.
The Cardinal not only acknowledged that the King had
asked his advice; he added that he had given it strongly
in favour of the arrest of M. d’Ornano, which he considered
absolutely necessary for the good of the State and of
Monsieur himself. Gaston replied with insulting language
and flung away.</p>

<p>“The Cardinal hated Monsieur,” says a writer of the
time, and we can well believe it—with the scornful hatred
of a proud and brilliant man bearing the whole burden of
the State on his shoulders, and finding himself constantly
thwarted and threatened by an insolent, privileged boy.
He hated him more because of the reconciliations he had
to arrange, the flatteries he had to use, the fatherly yet
respectful manner in which the King’s brother must be
treated by the King’s First Minister—conscious, for the
next dozen years, that his sickly master might die childless
and be succeeded by this young fellow whose will and
power for mischief were only balanced by his weakness
of character. Until the birth of a Dauphin, in 1638, destroyed
Gaston’s political importance, he was to be the
chief obstacle in Richelieu’s career, the chief thorn in his
side.</p>

<p>The arrest of the Maréchal d’Ornano had all the effect
that Richelieu intended; but if it warned and terrified the
more prudent conspirators, it infuriated the bolder, younger
spirits of Monsieur’s faction. Madame de Chevreuse and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
a few young men, led by the Grand Prieur de Vendôme
and Henry de Talleyrand-Périgord, Comte de Chalais,
decided that Richelieu must die. They planned that
Monsieur should invite himself and a party of his friends
to dine with the Cardinal at Fleury, his country-house
near Fontainebleau. This gracious act might be supposed
to mean that the Prince forgave his friend’s arrest. But
the real intention was that the Cardinal’s guests should
murder him. In the confusion that would follow, Monsieur’s
party meant to do as they pleased with the King
and the government.</p>

<p>Richelieu was saved by the weakness of one of the
chief conspirators. The Comte de Chalais, Keeper of
the King’s Wardrobe, a young man of twenty-eight, was
at this time the favoured lover of Madame de Chevreuse.
He would have killed a dozen cardinals to please her,
and he was ready to stab her enemy with his own hand.
For all that, he ruined the enterprise. On the eve of the
great day he confided the plan to Commander de Valençay,
a loyal courtier, though a friend of his own.</p>

<p>M. de Bassompierre may tell the story, for he was at
Fontainebleau at the time.</p>

<p>“The said Commander reproached him for his treachery,
that being the King’s servant he should dare to undertake
this against his First Minister; saying that he must
give him warning, and that in case he refused to do this
he would do it himself: to which Chalais, being intimidated,
consented; and they both went in that same hour
to Fleury, in order to warn M. le Cardinal, who thanked
them, and begged them to go and inform the King of
the same: which they did; and the King, at eleven o’clock
in the evening, sent to order thirty of his gendarmes and
thirty light horse to go immediately to Fleury. The Queen-mother
also dispatched thither the nobles of her household.
It happened as Chalais had said: towards three o’clock in
the morning Monsieur’s officers arrived at Fleury, sent
to prepare his dinner. M. le Cardinal left them in the
house, came to Fontainebleau, and went straight to the
bed-chamber of Monsieur, who was getting up, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
sufficiently amazed to see him. He reproached Monsieur
for not having honoured him with his commands to
provide dinner, which he would have done as best he
could, and said that he had left the house in possession
of his people. After this, having handed Monsieur his
shirt, he went away to the King, and afterwards to the
Queen-mother” ... leaving Gaston effectually frightened
by his terrible coolness.</p>

<p>So ended the Fleury plot. The friends of M. de
Chalais were completely puzzled as to how the information
could have reached Richelieu, until, the Court having
returned to Paris, he made his confession to Madame
de Chevreuse, promising more faithfulness in future.</p>

<p>For a moment a kind of paralysis seems to have seized
both parties in the game. Ill in body and troubled in
mind, realising that his public life must be one long
struggle against deadly foes at home and abroad, Richelieu
actually offered his resignation to the King. It was plain,
he said, that he alone was the cause of divisions in the
State. His enemies were so many that he lived at Court
in continual peril of assassination. If it were the King’s
will that in spite of danger he should continue to serve
him, he was ready to do so, but he knew that his departure
would be for the peace of the realm. Writing also to
the Queen-mother, he begged her to take his part with
the King, adding that unless he could be more careful
of his health in future his career as a statesman would
of necessity be short.</p>

<p>Such fits of depression were nothing new. It is likely
enough that Richelieu was in earnest, for the moment
at least. But if his object was to measure the confidence
and loyalty he might expect from his master through
the difficult times he foresaw, the experiment succeeded.
In a long and kind letter, Louis refused to let his
Minister go.</p>

<p>“Mon Cousin,” he wrote, “... I have every confidence
in you, and never has any one served me as well as you....
I desire and beg you not to retire, for my affairs would
go ill.... I pray you to have no fear of the calumnies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
which in my Court no one can escape.... Be assured that
I will protect you against every one, and that I will never
abandon you. The Queen, my mother, promises you as
much.... Be assured that I shall never change, and that,
by whomsoever you may be attacked, you will have me
for your second.”</p>

<p>As to the Cardinal’s health, the King promised to spare
him as much as possible, to dispense him from all visits,
and to give him frequent rest and relaxation. Following
on these favours, he ordered him for his greater security
a guard of a hundred men.</p>

<p>After the Fleury affair, Richelieu retired for some days
to his house at Limours. Here, at the end of May, he
received two important visits. One was from the Prince
de Condé, tired of his isolation, alarmed by the fate of
d’Ornano, and convinced at length that the man at the
head of affairs would be safer as a friend than as an enemy.
He was well received, for Richelieu had already given
Louis XIII. the counsel which he now acted upon—the
wise counsel given long ago by the Duke of Milan to
Louis XI.—that the princes leagued against the King should
be divided amongst themselves.</p>

<p>Monsieur le Prince slept at Limours, and remained the
next day to dinner. He talked—Condé always talked
much and plausibly—and the Cardinal, by his own account,
listened respectfully and answered frankly. They discussed
the affairs of Monsieur. It was Condé’s opinion that he
should be kindly treated, but kept in his place: as to
the Maréchal d’Ornano, his arrest had been “a master-stroke”
and should be followed up by his trial. He
recommended to the Cardinal more caution in dealing
with powerful men, but would not hear of his retirement
from the head of affairs. It would be the ruin of the
State, he said. He told him that he had long desired his
friendship; that France had never before seen so great or
so disinterested a Minister, whose glorious deeds could
not be denied, even by his enemies. All this and much
more flattery ended in an alliance between the Prince and
the Cardinal, which actually lasted their lives. Condé<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
became a loyal subject of the King and a devoted adherent
and admirer of Richelieu.</p>

<p>The other visit was from Monsieur himself. The
consequences of this interview were not so lasting, though
for the moment satisfactory. The royal boy was in a
chastened frame of mind. He was ready to make his
formal submission to the King, without any condition,
even as to the safety of M. d’Ornano, who had thus a
foretaste of the destiny of all Monsieur’s friends. Richelieu’s
fatherly admonitions had their full effect. The next day,
in Paris—Pentecost, May 31—the Prince vowed on the
Gospels eternal love and loyalty to the King and to the
Queen his mother. A solemn family compact was drawn
up and signed: <i>Louis</i>, <i>Marie</i>, <i>Gaston</i>.</p>

<p>The Cardinal’s next step was the disgrace of M. d’Aligre,
the Chancellor, who had failed to face Monsieur in the
matter of d’Ornano’s arrest. The seals were transferred
to Michel de Marillac. Then the Vendôme princes had
their turn.</p>

<p>If the Duc de Vendôme—the “César-Monsieur” flattered
and feared by Henry IV.’s Court—had been a man of
character to match his position, no one of the great nobles
could have equalled him in power and popularity. Even
as a vain and vicious coward, few men in the kingdom
were more dangerous to Richelieu’s plans and Louis XIII.’s
government. From his province of Brittany, the Duke
had watched the failure of the great conspiracy in which
he and his brother were deeply engaged. They feared,
and with reason, that their own ruin would follow that
of the Maréchal d’Ornano. As the month of May passed,
and nothing was done, César proceeded to fortify himself
at Nantes, while Alexandre, a bolder man, watched events
in Paris and sought, not without success, to discover the
real mind of his half-brother the King.</p>

<p>Early in June came the startling news that Louis and
the Court were setting out for Brittany. They were
already on the road, and the Cardinal, lingering a few
days at Limours for his health’s sake, was about to follow,
when he was unexpectedly visited by Alexandre de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
Vendôme, hurrying post-haste to fetch his brother from
Nantes to meet the displeased King.</p>

<p>From Richelieu’s own account, it was a characteristic
interview. He had long distrusted these two young men,
whom Henry IV. had indulged and exalted with the
short-sighted idea that they would be Louis XIII.’s most
loyal subjects. On the contrary, says Richelieu, both
contributed to every effort that was made to shake the
royal authority, and both—had they been able—would
have done the kingdom irreparable harm. With grim
satisfaction the Cardinal saw these royal birds now
struggling in the net he had spread for them. It was not
necessary to spare them as Gaston, legitimate prince and
heir-presumptive, had been spared.</p>

<p>Richelieu has been accused of deceiving the Grand
Prior with false hopes of favour and clemency, thus
encouraging him to place his brother and himself in the
King’s hands. He might have thought himself justified
in doing so, if necessary. On the contrary, if he is to
be believed, he tried to guard against any accusation of
the kind. He pretended to be aware neither of the
anxious terror that had brought the young man to Limours,
nor of the “fausse hardiesse” which led him to play this
game of bluff for himself and for his brother, acting
innocence and a frank readiness to face the King.</p>

<p>“When the Grand Prior told the Cardinal that he was
going to fetch his brother, he did not answer him that
he was doing either well or ill, because he saw that they
could not save themselves, or resist the King’s power,
if they remained in Brittany, and he thought it better
that His Majesty should take the trouble to fetch them
thence, or even take them on their road, than give them
a pretext to say” (what they did say) “that they had
been attracted by fine words, deceived and caught by
false hopes.”</p>

<p>Finding that the Cardinal would give him no clear
lead, Alexandre de Vendôme hastened on his way. A
few days later, he and his brother, “making a virtue of
necessity,” met the King at Blois. The next day, both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
were arrested and conveyed to the castle of Amboise,
from which they were transferred to Vincennes. The
Duc de Vendôme’s question—“What about Monsieur?
Has he been arrested or no?”—was hardly needed to
warn Richelieu, who arrived at Blois that same evening,
that the conspiracy was still alive and dangerous.</p>

<p>The Comte de Chalais, unimaginably rash and foolish,
was playing a game he could only lose. His escape after
the Fleury affair had been narrow enough, and he had
then solemnly promised loyalty to the Cardinal, even
undertaking to act as his spy, informing him of any evil
counsels that might reach Monsieur. But Chalais was
not his own master. Madame de Chevreuse drove him
into a path where there was no more turning back, and
after the arrest of the Vendôme princes he became the
active agent and cat’s-paw of a new combination of old
rebel forces which swiftly dragged Monsieur into its
centre, his vows of loyalty hardly spoken and the ink
of his signature not yet dry.</p>

<p>While the King continued his slow progress into
Brittany to assure himself of the loyalty of the province,
he was actually enveloped in a cloud of conspiracy. Every
night, according to Bassompierre, the Comte de Chalais
visited Monsieur in his room, and for two or three hours
talked and plotted treason: an easy adventure for the
Master of the King’s Wardrobe, who had his lodging close
to royalty. The plan was that Monsieur should leave the
Court and fly either south-west or north-east; either to the
Huguenots at La Rochelle, prepared to receive him by
the influence of Madame de Chevreuse and Madame de
Rohan, or to the Duc d’Épernon and his son at Metz. The
Comte de Soissons, whom the King had left behind as
governor of Paris, furious at the arrest of his friends the
Vendôme princes, was eager not only to help with arms
and men towards a civil war, but to seize his own advantage
by carrying off Mademoiselle de Montpensier.</p>

<p>This last detail of the plot, it seems, was the first
to reach the King’s ears, and he defeated it by sending
for the heiress and her mother, the Duchesse de Guise,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
who immediately followed the Court on its westward
journey.</p>

<p>This piece of ill-luck was swiftly followed by others.
Monsieur himself was undecided, timid, difficult to move
to instant action. Disliking the Huguenot leaders, he was
unwilling to place himself in their hands. Metz was his
favourite idea; but the Marquis de la Valette would not act
independently of his father, and the old Duc d’Épernon,
it seems, had had enough of quarrels with the King, for he
went so far as to send him the letter that Monsieur had
written.</p>

<p>Richelieu seems to have felt a certain scornful pity for
the unfortunate Chalais, whose evil report was brought to
him by other spies. More than once he had him warned
that he was on the road to ruin; yet “the poor gentleman”
went on with his desperate schemes. And even the spies
had not discovered the extent of these. Chalais was
betrayed to his destruction by a friend, the Comte de
Louvigny, who quarrelled with him because he would not
take his side in some trivial dispute with the Comte de
Candale, another son of the Duc d’Épernon. Chalais made
it clear that neither he nor his friends could afford to be on
ill terms with that family.</p>

<p>This quarrel took place between Saumur and Nantes,
as the Court travelled down the Loire in all the fresh
beauty of early summer. M. de Bassompierre, who was
present, a courtier of long experience, thought nothing of
it—a mere matter of an <i>amourette</i>—and it is pretty certain
that public opinion was with him in denouncing Louvigny
as “ce méchant garçon” for the revenge he took. Having
been known as “parfait ami de Chalais,” the confidant of
his secrets, he straightway poured them all into the ears of
the Cardinal and the King. Bassompierre hints that in his
rage and spite he told even more than the truth; but that
alone was enough to condemn Chalais.</p>

<p>He was arrested at Nantes on July 8. On the 11th, the
Estates of Brittany were opened by the King amid loyal
rejoicings, a new governor, the Maréchal de Thémines, taking
the place of the Duc de Vendôme. By this appointment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
Richelieu showed a certain magnanimity; forgetting his
own brother’s death at the hands of the Maréchal’s son, he
remembered and rewarded the old soldier’s faithfulness in
1616, when by the arrest of Condé he had checked the
rebel party and lightened the task of the Richelieu-Barbin
ministry.</p>

<p>While Chalais lay in prison through those summer days,
his fate, if ever doubtful, was decided by the poltroonery
of the prince for whom he had conspired. To assure his
own safety and to gain some of his ends, if not all,
Monsieur made a full confession to the Cardinal first, then
to the King in Council. In his long and confused declarations,
preserved in the French Archives, a few points stand
out clearly: that he described all his plans against the
State, especially against the Cardinal; treason, revolt,
murder, and civil war: that he denounced all his friends,
not only d’Ornano and Chalais, but his Vendôme half-brothers,
the Comte de Soissons and many more. He did
not quite spare Madame de Chevreuse or even the Queen.
On the other hand, he once again promised obedience to
the King and consented to marry Mademoiselle de Montpensier;
but the reward he asked for his submission was
not, as it might well have been, the pardon of his friends,
but the great appanage that he had long demanded. Richelieu
found it politic to satisfy him so far, and Gaston
became Duke of Orléans and of Chartres and Count of
Blois; but his actual income, in the form of pensions, still
depended largely on the pleasure of the King.</p>

<p>“After which,” says Richelieu, “the marriage was made
without further difficulty on Monsieur’s side. The Cardinal
married them on August 5, in the Chapel of the Fathers of
the Oratory at Nantes, in whose house the Queen-mother
was lodged.”</p>

<p>In the last days, when the formalities of the trial of
Chalais were already begun, Monsieur made some weak
attempt to save him; but the victim was marked for death.
His own prayers, entreaties, and despairing confessions,
his mother’s agonised letter to the King, the efforts of
some of his friends—more courageous than Madame de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
Chevreuse, who dared not even answer his last adoring
letters—were all of no avail. He was condemned to the
frightful death of a traitor.</p>

<p>The King commuted its worst horrors. Chalais was
beheaded at Nantes on August 19. At the end he bore his
fate like a soldier; and if his agony was unusually long
and terrible, the cause lay in the mistaken kindness of his
friends, who had managed to kidnap the public executioner.
His place was taken by a condemned wretch from the
prison who thus earned his own pardon. They say that at
the twentieth blow from that unskilful arm young Chalais
still groaned—“Jésus Maria!” and a shudder of pity ran
through the staring crowd.</p>

</div>

<p>Richelieu had triumphed. Monsieur was safely
married; for the moment contented and <i>rangé</i>. The
restless, foolish, unhappy Chalais was dead; the
Maréchal d’Ornano had died in prison, not without a
suspicion of poison which seems unjustified; the Vendôme
brothers were securely bolted into the damp dungeons of
Vincennes; the Comte de Soissons had fled to Savoy;
Madame de Chevreuse, banished from the Court, had taken
refuge with Duke Charles of Lorraine; Queen Anne was
in disgrace. Conspiracy was scotched, if not killed; the
storm had blown over, and the highest in France, it seemed,
lay at the Cardinal’s mercy.</p>

<p>By two popular edicts he pursued his plan of crushing
the nobles and making the King supreme. One destroyed,
first in Brittany, then all over France, every feudal stronghold
that was not needed for the defence of province or
kingdom. Such a measure was something of a revolution,
for it struck sharply at the local strength and independent
authority of the nobles, great and small. Peasants and
townspeople were delighted to help the royal officials in
smashing gates and tearing down tall watch-towers and
walls six feet thick, which had threatened their liberty for
so many centuries. As is usual in revolutions, a good
deal of injustice was done; many proprietors suffered for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
the sins of a few; promised indemnities were not paid.
And after all, Richelieu or no Richelieu, civilisation was
in fact advancing. Manners were changing. Every year
widened the difference between the centuries, left Henry IV.
farther behind and brought Louis XIV. nearer. Richelieu,
in his dealing with the great men, their fortresses and
their governments, only hurried the inevitable march. But
he also gained his own immediate ends.</p>

<p>The other famous edict forbade duels. They had long
been forbidden, under the severest penalties; but the
passions of men and the usages of society had been too
strong for the law, which had become almost a dead letter.
The nobles of France fought each other “by day and night,
by moonlight, by torchlight, in the public streets and
squares,” and on the slightest quarrel. The Church protested,
the law threatened, without avail. Richelieu once
more brought forward the royal authority, forbidding duels
on pain of death, with the firm intention of making an
example of any man who should dare to disobey.</p>

<p>The occasion was not long in coming. François de
Montmorency, Comte de Bouteville, was one of the best-known
duellists in France—or in Europe, for that matter.
At twenty-seven he had already fought twenty-two duels.
Fighting was his passion. “If you want to fight,” said the
Président de Chevry to a punctilious gentleman, “go and
pull a hair out of Bouteville’s beard; <i>il vous fera passer
votre envie</i>.”</p>

<p>In the spring of 1627 Bouteville was in Flanders, having
made France too hot to hold him. The Archduchess
Isabel, from her Court at Brussels, wrote to ask his
pardon of Louis XIII., who refused it, adding, however,
that he might return to France safe from justice, on
condition that he appeared neither in Paris nor at Court.
This answer touched Bouteville’s pride. He had a quarrel
with the Baron de Beuvron; he resolved to fight it out
in Paris in the teeth of King, Cardinal, and edicts new
and old. Each man had two seconds: it was a triple duel
with swords, three against three; and it was fought in
broad daylight in the Place Royale, the most fashionable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
square in Paris. The windows of the high red houses
were crowded with spectators.</p>

<p>Both principals escaped unhurt; but the Comte des
Chapelles, Bouteville’s second, killed his adversary, M. de
Bussy d’Amboise, governor of Vitry. Honour being satisfied,
the survivors fled for their lives. M. de Beuvron and
two other men got away safely to England. M. de Bouteville
and M. des Chapelles, on their way to Lorraine, were
foolhardy enough to sleep at Vitry, where the fatal news
had outrun them, and “the dead man’s mother,” says
Bassompierre, “arrested them.”</p>

<p>They were brought back to Paris, imprisoned in the
Bastille, and after a short trial sentenced to death. Then
the whole opinion of society rose passionately in their
favour. Such edicts were useless; human nature could
not obey them. Men must quarrel, and there was one
honourable, approved way of settling their quarrels: they
must fight. If they did not they were scorned as cowards;
the King himself sneered at their prudence, their obedience
to his own edicts. Thus cried every gentleman in France,
and the Cardinal’s heart must have echoed the cry. Though
he would not save the victims, saying that it was a question
which throat should be cut—that of the duel or that of
the law; though he listened unmoved to the prayers of
their friends and relations—the Princesse de Condé and
the Duc de Montmorency were Bouteville’s cousins, for the
best blood of France ran in his veins—yet the words with
which, in his <i>Memoirs</i>, he mourns the two young men,
have a ring of sincerity. Famous for courage in their
lives, it did not fail them, he says, at the approach of a
disgraceful death.</p>

<p>“There was nothing feeble in their speech, nothing low
in their actions. They received the news of death as if it
had been that of pardon.... They were well prepared
to die.... There was one difference between them:
Bouteville appeared sad in those last hours, and the Comte
des Chapelles joyful; Bouteville sad for the faults he had
committed, and the other joyful for the hope he had of
Paradise.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>The two were beheaded in the Place de Grève on
June 21, 1627. Their deaths, following on his signal
triumphs of the preceding year, made the name of Richelieu
hateful and terrible to the nobles of France. They began
to feel that he might be as almighty in power as he was
relentless in action. But they did not cease to fight
duels.</p>

<p>Another tragic event in the early summer of that year
was the death of Monsieur’s young wife, a few days after
the birth of her child—not the prince whose arrival had
been anxiously expected all the winter, the suspense adding
pride and importance to Monsieur and Madame, gloom and
jealousy to the King and Queen—but a princess, afterwards
known as the Grande Mademoiselle, the greatest heiress in
Europe, whose distinguished, eccentric presence was to be
familiar to the French Court for more than sixty years.</p>

<p>“That death,” says Bassompierre, “changed the face of
the Court, gave rise to new designs, and in short was the
cause of many evils which have since come to pass.”</p>

<p>The Duchess had no more sincere mourner than Cardinal
de Richelieu. “Deplorable ... prejudicial to the
welfare of the State,” he writes of the death of Madame,
“... who in ten months was wife of a great prince,
sister-in-law of the three first and greatest kings of
Christendom, a mother, and a corpse.”</p>

<p>The Cardinal had good reasons for his regret. Monsieur,
who since his marriage had lived peaceably, content with
his own trifling amusements, influenced by his wife’s gentle
attraction rather than by a set of ambitious favourites, now
became once more a centre of varied intrigue. And it was
not only his ready disloyalty, but the constant scandal of
his private life, which induced Louis XIII. and Richelieu
to do their best to satisfy his restless spirit. The foolish
and vicious boy, a widower at nineteen, was after all the
only hope of the direct royal line.</p>

<p>By way of consoling the Prince and occupying his mind,
“the King,” says a memoir-writer of that century, “proposed
to him all kinds of honest exercise, principally that
of the chase: there being hardly a day on which His Majesty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
did not so divert himself, he imagined that Monsieur
would take the same pleasure in it”—which he did not,
being a Parisian and a gambler. “And since Monsieur
possessed no house near Paris where he could sometimes
take the air, His Majesty thought well to give him that of
Limours, belonging to the Cardinal de Richelieu; thus
gratifying His Highness in the belief that he would take
pleasure in beautifying it. It was purchased at the same
price for which it had been acquired, which amounted to
400,000 <i>livres</i>, including the domain of Montlhéry; and with
a further payment of 300,000 <i>livres</i> to the Cardinal de
Richelieu, as well for the furniture as for his expenditure
and the improvements he had made.”</p>

<p>The writer goes on to explain that the Cardinal gladly
seized this opportunity of getting rid of Limours.</p>

<p>“The Cardinal was disgusted with that house, finding
it unpleasant and unhealthy; both because of its low
situation, yet without fountains or other waters, and because
of many other things that were lacking; and he was happy
to seize a good chance of getting rid of it, and greatly to his
advantage; which he could not have expected in any other
quarter. For the Queen-mother’s persuasion decided the
King to gratify the Cardinal her creature, in whom she had
then every confidence.”</p>

<p>The last sentence hardly bears the stamp of truth. In
the year 1627 and later, Richelieu could not be described
as the creature of Marie de Médicis, and her confidence in
him had almost ceased to exist.</p>

<p>In the spring of that year the discontent between France
and England flashed out into war. This had been imminent
since the early autumn of 1626, when Charles I. roughly
drove out his wife’s French household; and Bassompierre’s
embassy of remonstrance had only smoothed matters over
for the time. Richelieu did not desire war with England;
it meant a new struggle with the Huguenots. He intended
to fix his own date for that, and to make it final. He was
not yet ready. But this time Buckingham’s jealous anger
and restless ambition were strong enough to force his hand.
Louis XIII. had refused to receive the Duke again at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
French Court. This, according to contemporaries, be they
right or wrong, was the chief and secret cause of the war.
Outwardly, it was brought about by quarrels and piracies
on both sides at sea, as well as by Charles I.’s sympathy
with the oppressed Huguenots; but every enemy of
Richelieu’s government, Protestant or Catholic, was more
or less drawn into a coalition against him. Not only the
Duc de Soubise and his friends in England, and the Duc
de Rohan in Languedoc, but Duke Charles of Lorraine,
influenced by Madame de Chevreuse, the Duke of Savoy
and his guest the Comte de Soissons, and the Archduchess
Isabel, ruler of the Low Countries, who did her best to
draw Spain to England’s side, were concerned in this great
enterprise of crushing Cardinal de Richelieu. As a fact, at
this very time, Spain and France were allied by treaty
against England; but Richelieu differed from the Queen-mother
and the rest of the Catholic party in profoundly
distrusting Olivarez; and he knew, quite as well as his
many enemies did, that an English victory would leave
France, divided in herself, standing alone against Europe.</p>

<p>From mid-winter onward, the English fleet was preparing;
through what enormous difficulties, readers of
English history know. From week to week, all through
the spring, more and more alarming reports crossed the
Channel: the English were coming; any day might see
their sails in the north-west, bearing down on the coast of
France. La Rochelle was their destination; but they could
not reach the Huguenot city without first seizing one or
both of the islands, Ré and Oléron, which guard it from
the sea. Of these, Ré was now the strongest, new royal
forts having been built there since the last Huguenot revolt,
to overawe the town. Convinced that the English “could
do nothing there,” Richelieu threw himself with fiery energy
into the task of strengthening Oléron and the forts on the
mainland. His letters, written during those months to the
governors of towns and castles on the coast, especially to
M. de Guron, governor of Marans, M. de Launay-Razilly,
commanding in Oléron, M. de Toiras and others, including
his brother-in-law the Marquis de Brézé, and his friend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
and lieutenant M. de Sourdis, Bishop of Maillezais, afterwards
Archbishop of Bordeaux—kinsman and successor of
his enemy Cardinal <i>Sordido</i>—are a really wonderful study.
Few great statesmen have shown such a genius for detail.
As the danger approached his letters flew to all parts of
the coast, and in reading them one may almost hear the
heavy strokes of the axe in Breton forests, the hammering
of ship-builders, the creaking of cordage, the clank of arms
and the rolling of cannon-balls, the rumbling of waggons
laden with tools, powder, provisions for the islands. M. de
Guron, through those months of March, April and May, can
have slept but little. He had to understand “at half a word.”
He had to cope with the angry tempers of the men who
worked under him; he had to consider the poor people of
the islands and to take care that the soldiers did not oppress
them. Over and over again Richelieu writes in the interest
of the peasants; they must not be taxed or tormented. In
fact, they were neighbours of his old Luçon days; a very
few miles to the north, the spire of his cathedral rose over
the marshes; almost every letter shows his familiarity with
every inch of that coast.</p>

<p>Another characteristic point is the gentle tone in which
Richelieu writes of the Huguenots, grimly watching from
the walls of La Rochelle the strengthening of the islands,
the gathering of armies, the hurrying to their coast of a
crowd of young Catholic nobles, the desperate energy of
equipment with which ships and boats were being collected
from north and south to meet the coming storm. The
people of La Rochelle were anxious, and with reason.
Their minds were divided, not altogether rejoicing in the
English descent, as they proved a little later—for when
the Duc de Soubise, coming from England, presented
himself at the gates, they were shut against him until his
mother, old Madame de Rohan of the dreams and visions,
went down herself to the harbour, commanded that the
gates should be opened, took his hand and led him in.
The citizens of La Rochelle might resist the rulers of their
own country, but they were not unanimously ready to
welcome a foreign invader, and it was Richelieu’s policy to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
encourage this doubtfulness. Writing to M. de Navailles,
commander of the cavalry in the island of Ré, he more than
once enjoins him to assure Messieurs de la Rochelle, who
might be disquieted by the warlike preparations going on
at their very gates, of the excellent intentions of His
Majesty. They need fear nothing, as long as they paid
him the respect and obedience they owed. These military
works were not for their harm, but for his own security.
Again, writing to his uncle the Commander de la Porte,
governor of Angers, Richelieu says: “Let the Huguenots
spread what reports they will: provided they continue in
obedience, they will always be well treated. We intend
no harm to them, but only to prevent their doing any.”</p>

<p>The alarms and the frenzied preparations went on
through the spring and far into the summer, and were
at their height while the Bouteville affair and the death
of Madame occupied the mind of Paris. On the day of
the royal obsequies at Saint-Denis, the English fleet had
already sailed from “Porsemus,” as Richelieu spells it,
and ten or twelve days later it appeared off La Rochelle.
Louis XIII. had already left Paris for the west coast.
Monsieur was appointed lieutenant-general of the royal
armies in Poitou, which were actually commanded by the
King’s old cousin, the Duc d’Angoulême, with Louis de
Marillac, brother of the Chancellor, as second in command,
and by the Marshals de Schomberg and de Bassompierre.
Later in the year, the Prince de Condé and the Duc de
Montmorency were charged with checking the Duc de
Rohan in Languedoc. By that time, Toiras being blockaded
by the English in the Isle of Ré, and the attitude
of La Rochelle being no longer doubtful, Richelieu had
ceased to show patience and toleration of the King’s rebels.
The day he had long foreseen had at last arrived. “Faut
ruiner les Huguenots. Si Ré se sauve, facile. S’il se
perd, plus difficile, mais faisable et nécessaire comme
l’unique remède de la perte de Ré. Autrement les Anglois
et Rochelois seroyent unis et puissans.”</p>

<p>These notes form part of a report drawn up by the
Cardinal’s secretaries of an interview between himself and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
Condé, which took place at Richelieu in the early autumn.
The words may probably have been Condé’s: that foolish
firebrand was in favour of setting the whole kingdom in
a blaze of religious war, of persecuting the Protestants
and pulling down their houses, in hopes that they might
make such reprisals as would infuriate the country against
them and lead to something like their extermination.
These mad ideas were far enough from Richelieu; but
he, equally with Condé, was now resolved to crush the
rebel power, and to bring all Frenchmen under the King’s
authority.</p>

<p>But a long and difficult struggle lay before him.</p>

<p>The King was ill when he left Paris, and after one day’s
journey fever seized him so violently that he could go
no farther. For weeks he lay between life and death at
Villeroy, on the road to Orléans. He was there in the
middle of July, when a courier arrived from the Marquis
de Brézé, bringing news that the English had landed in
Ré, and after sharp fighting, many precious lives being
lost on both sides, had forced M. de Toiras to retire into
the fort of Saint-Martin, where he was closely besieged.
No one disputed the desperate courage of Toiras; but he
earned great blame from the Cardinal for his rashness
and want of foresight; the citadel being hardly in a state
of defence, and provisioned for seven or eight weeks only.
Boasting that he could drive off the English with one arm,
he had indeed never faced the possibility of being shut
up in Saint-Martin. The despised enemy was to teach him
a sharp lesson.</p>

<p>The situation was serious to the last degree, and
Richelieu had to meet it alone. The King was far too
ill to hear such news, and his life was more valuable to
France than any forts and islands: the Cardinal had to
accept a responsibility never yet openly his. Walking
gingerly in a crowd of enemies, he had till now sheltered
himself under the authority of the King. Now he rose
supreme, to give those “prompt and powerful orders”
which, as he says, were the only way to face the storm.
“A thousand cares tormented and agitated his mind; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
the greatest of all, which troubled him most, was to show
no anxiety before the King.... All the day he was with
him; at night he seldom left him; and yet his mind was
always busy with the orders which secretly, from hour
to hour, he had to send out for the succour of the island
and the hindering of the English.... For he heard that
there was scarcity in the forts of Ré, and that, if not
promptly relieved, they were lost.”</p>

<p>From the gates of Villeroy rode couriers, agents, envoys,
carrying orders and money to all parts. The State funds
were so low that Richelieu was compelled to use his own
money and credit: he ventured all without hesitation. He
sent a large sum to Le Havre, for the equipment of five
ships; to Saint-Malo, for eight ships and eleven great guns;
to Brouage and Les Sables d’Olonne, that any quantity
of provisions of all kinds, wine, meat, flour, biscuit, might
be ready to be thrown into the besieged citadel. For that
purpose he ordered a number of pinnaces from Bayonne
and the river-mouths on the Bay of Biscay, which could
approach the islands, sailing or rowing, when the weather
made large ships useless. Three bold sea-captains, Beaulieu,
Courcelles, and Canteleu, promised to carry victuals into
Ré or to die in the attempt. Richelieu invited help from
Spain, in accordance with treaties; but that cautious
government waited to send ships till Buckingham had
sailed away for England and something like a French
navy, created by Richelieu’s marvellous practical energy
and commanded by the Duc de Guise, was cruising in the
waters of La Rochelle.</p>

<p>This did not happen till December. No relief of Saint-Martin
became possible till the first days of October, when
on a stormy night a number of small boats slipped through
the English fleet and brought in a supply of provisions
and a reinforcement of four hundred men to M. de Toiras
and his starving, exhausted garrison. By this time the
King had recovered, and he and the Cardinal had joined
the army before La Rochelle.</p>

<p>With their arrival the luck turned, and the English
attack began to fail, though the people of La Rochelle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
were now ready to give Buckingham everything he wanted,
except—for after all, they were French—a permanent
foothold in their islands. The commanders on the coast,
under Richelieu’s immediate orders, worked with double
activity. Schomberg landed in Ré, Saint-Martin was
relieved, and after some hard fighting the English were
driven back with serious loss to their ships. A few days
later Buckingham sailed away to England, leaving behind
him the best part of his army, colours, horses, guns, and
baggage. He never saw France again. The English flags
taken in Ré were carried in triumph through Paris and
hung up in Notre Dame.</p>

<p>And now the fight, one of the sternest in history, the
details of which would fill a volume, was between Cardinal
de Richelieu and the proud old city of La Rochelle, the
stronghold which for two hundred years, either in politics
or religion, had repeatedly and successfully braved the kings
of France. “The Cardinal had to expect,” says M. Martin,
“a terrible resistance. The population of La Rochelle,
swelled by the zealous Huguenots of the surrounding
country, numbered at least thirty thousand souls—a race of
fierce and intrepid corsairs, hardened to fatigue and danger,
accustomed, for sixty years past, to live with restless
vigilance in the perpetual state of siege which they had
imposed on themselves in order to preserve their stormy
liberties.”</p>

<p>These liberties Richelieu was resolved that they should
no longer enjoy. And except for the support of the King
and of his few trusted lieutenants, he was almost alone
in that resolution. The nobles of France, even the commanders
of the army, saw very well that the entire conquest
of the Huguenots was a long step towards their own
impotence under an absolute King and a strong Minister.
Even the gay soldier Bassompierre said half seriously,
“We shall be fools enough to take La Rochelle!” Such
opinions, of which he was well aware, did not give the
Cardinal a moment’s pause. He made some attempt to
disarm his enemies by civilities to the Queen-mother,
by obtaining a Cardinal’s Hat for her saintly and distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
friend Père de Bérulle—his own friend in
his Luçon days; but he was too clever to expect much
result, and he probably cared little at this moment, when
all his instincts of a soldier, a born general, were flaming
up within him at the sight of camps to be ruled, armies
to be moved, great towering walls to be laid low. Ruin
might follow, if it must: the Huguenots should have
their lesson.</p>

<p>He had summoned Père Joseph, his chief counsellor, to
join him before La Rochelle. The Capuchin walked from
Paris in leisurely fashion, visiting convents in Poitou
and preaching by the way. He reached the camp on
one of those days in October when the Cardinal, lately
arrived, was absent on the coast directing the despatch
of fresh troops and stores to the islands. He was
lodged in the Cardinal’s quarters, a small moated house
called Pont-la-Pierre, on the sand-hills, only a hundred
paces from the flat sea-shore at Angoulins, just south of
La Rochelle. That very night there was an alarm that
five hundred men were coming in boats from the town,
to blow up the house and kill or capture the Cardinal.
Though two regiments, according to Bassompierre, were
quartered at Angoulins, the house was outside immediate
help, and on a dark and windy night might well be surprised.
Père Joseph had scarcely arrived when he was
invaded by M. de Marillac and two hundred musketeers.
A whole army indeed was on foot to receive the adventurers.
Regiments were lying flat among the dunes; the
King himself was on horseback all night in heavy rain,
watching behind Pont-la-Pierre with a troop of cavalry.
All these precautions seemed absurd to Bassompierre
and his brother officers, who did not love the Cardinal
or appreciate the King’s anxious care for his safety.
After all, the expected attack did not come off. Either
the men of La Rochelle were warned, or, as Père Joseph
thought, the weather was too much for them. He himself
was praised by the King for his intrepidity; for when
he might have retired to the royal quarters he preferred to
remain at Pont-la-Pierre in charge of the Cardinal’s papers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>The character of Louis XIII. never shows so well as
in time of war. The gloomy, nervous, irresolute young
man was a daring soldier. In spite of his weak health
he shunned no hardship; the outdoor endurance learnt
in the hunting-field proved itself of real value in battle
and siege. Early in December of that year, when the
regular blockade of La Rochelle had begun, Cardinal
de Richelieu wrote to the Queen-mother with a report
of the King’s health:</p>

<p>“... Although the country is most evil, tempest, wind
and rain being the usual course, and the soil constantly
a quagmire, His Majesty does not cease to dwell here
with as much gaiety as if he were in the most beautiful
place in the world.... He is constantly at work ... he
has regulated his army, reformed his regiments ... he
reviews his army, visits his works.... The day before
yesterday he spent three hours on the dyke that he is
making, to bar the harbour. Not only did he overlook
the work, but set an example by working with his own
hands. His Majesty alone does much more to advance
his affairs than all those who have the honour to be
employed under his command. The men of La Rochelle
make little sorties, but are always beaten back.”</p>

<p>The Cardinal was wise enough to give the King the
credit of all his own marvellous doings at this time. It
was practicable to blockade La Rochelle by land; but
as long as the harbour and channel were open, it was
impossible to hinder the city from receiving supplies by
sea. At the same time, the difficulties connected with
the land siege were considerable enough; and the army
regulations carried out by Richelieu, mentioned in his
letter to Marie de Médicis, were as stern as they were
necessary. Three leagues of circumvallation, strengthened
by forts and redoubts, had to be held by a host of
more or less undisciplined men, whose careless commanders
thought more of their own interests and their
own quarrels than of the service of the King. Before
Louis and the Cardinal arrived on the scene, the Duc
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>d’Angoulême had been negligent or humane enough to
allow the Rochellois to come out into their fields and
gather in their harvest; and after the siege had really
begun, he allowed a hundred and twenty oxen to be
smuggled one night into the city. It might have cost a
lesser man his head.</p>

<p>Richelieu once in full authority, no more such weakness
was shown; but if implacably stern towards the besieged,
he showed himself just and benevolent towards both the
King’s soldiers and the poor peasants of that unhappy
land, who had dragged on miserable lives through
generations of religious wars. The soldiers were forbidden
to rob the peasants, or to interfere with their field work.
The army was regularly paid and provided with food
and clothing, while the officers found themselves reinforced
and overshadowed by a crowd of warlike ecclesiastics,
the Bishops of Maillezais, of Mende, of Nîmes, and others,
not to mention Père Joseph and his train of friars, who
fought and fortified, preached and prayed, besieging the
heretics in the spirit of crusaders and waging a holy war
for Richelieu’s political ends.</p>

<p>The Duc d’Angoulême, with his fellow generals Schomberg
and Bassompierre—Monsieur having quickly withdrawn
from the uncomfortable siege to find amusement
and mischief in Paris—commanding an army from which
blasphemy and crime were banished, were charged with
the land blockade and with such outside work as pulling
down the castles of rebel Huguenot nobles in the neighbouring
country—among them that of the Duc de Soubise.
Warned by such severities, and impressed by the failure
of the English to succour La Rochelle, several of the
Huguenot gentlemen of Poitou came into the camp to
assure the King of their loyalty. The most distinguished
among them, the Duc de la Trémoïlle, listened to the
persuasive voice of Père Joseph and became a Catholic,
and certain of his friends followed his example—a signal
triumph for Richelieu which was not encouraging to the
starving heroes of La Rochelle. Towards the same time
the young Comte de Soissons returned from Savoy, and
instead of supporting the Duc de Rohan, as he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
threatened, in Languedoc, asked the King’s pardon and
joined the royal army.</p>

<p>In February 1628 the King’s cheerful interest in the
siege suddenly failed. The monotony of camp life, the
slow advance of the necessary works, and the horrible
weather, bored him unbearably: “son ennui vint jusqu’à
tel point,” writes Richelieu, “qu’il estimoit sa vie être en
péril s’il ne faisoit un tour à Paris.” He may probably
have been right, for the damp marshes on which the
army lived were hardly healthy for a man subject to
low fever; Richelieu himself was prostrated by it several
times in that spring. All the same, he was angry and
scornful at the King’s desertion. He was also uneasy
on his own account, for Paris seethed with the intrigues
of his deadly enemies, and political clouds were gathering
in the south. For a moment it seemed possible that La
Rochelle would escape: the departure of both King and
Cardinal would have brought the siege to an end. In
remaining alone, Richelieu made a bold venture which
was justified. The King returned from Paris in April;
in the meanwhile, he made the Cardinal his lieutenant-general,
with supreme authority over his forces by land
and sea.</p>

<p>Richelieu’s first care was to finish the great dyke or
mole by means of which alone the harbour of La Rochelle
could be barred against all entrance from the sea. Two
famous workmen from Paris, Métezeau and Tiriot, engineer
and master-mason, undertook this tremendous piece of
work, at which the regiments laboured in turn. Several
times, in the early winter, the great beams and blocks of
stone were swept away by furious seas, but Richelieu only
began again: the two arms of the mole were well advanced
in spring, and the Rochellois could watch from their ramparts
the growing of those cruel prison walls against which
Atlantic waves tumbled in vain. The narrow passage in
the centre was blocked by sunken ships laden with stones,
and then the doomed city was in the hands of her
enemies: they had only to wait for her surrender.</p>

<p>We may see Cardinal de Richelieu as artists have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
fancied him, standing on the wet rugged stones of the great
mole, green water washing and foaming almost round his
feet. Immense hulls of English ships loom in the offing, and
small boats full of armed men are dancing on the waves.
The gigantic beams of the <i>chevaux de frise</i> protecting the
mole are splintered by cannon-balls. A fresh breeze is
blowing: the Cardinal’s scarlet cloak falls back from his
slight steel-clad shoulders; he wears a sword; he is bare-headed,
except for a skull-cap. He stands in his high boots,
with folded arms, looking out to sea, unmoved, confident
in his defences; while a group of soldiers and ecclesiastics,
some yards behind him, talk and stare excitedly.</p>

<p>The Cardinal’s mole and his other fortifications were too
much for the English fleet when it returned in May: it
hardly even attempted an attack, but sailed away in a week,
leaving La Rochelle a prey to famine, though not yet to
despair.</p>

<p>The story of that terrible summer has often been told:
how fresh English promises, with the desperate heroism of
Guiton, the famous mayor, encouraged the town to hold
out to the last; how the weak died by thousands, and the
strong lived on grass, shell-fish, stewed hides and leather
and worse food still; how old men, women and children,
driven out of the city as useless mouths, were not allowed,
even at the request of Madame de Rohan, to pass through
the royal lines, but were forced to turn back, so that many,
the gates being shut upon them, died miserably between
the walls and the camp.</p>

<p>It was the end of September, three weeks after the
murder of Buckingham, when an English fleet and army
arrived at last, too late: a French fleet awaited them,
French batteries were in full force. The harbour was not
to be entered, even by means of fire-ships, and after two
days’ hard fighting the winds of heaven declared themselves
against the luckless city; a gale forced the English to run
for shelter, and the prayers of La Rochelle could not induce
them to renew the battle. A week later the city surrendered
to the King: quite half her population were dead;
less than two hundred remained of her heroic fighting men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>On October 30 Cardinal de Richelieu entered the city
on horseback. It was a fearful sight. “On trouva la ville
pleine de morts, dans les chambres, dans les maisons, et
dans les rues et places publiques;” for the wretched
survivors had lacked strength to bury their dead. On the
morning of All Saints’ Day the victorious commander said
mass in the reconsecrated Church of Sainte-Marguerite,
assisted by his lieutenant, M. de Sourdis, now Archbishop
of Bordeaux. He then carried the keys of the city to meet
the King, who made his state entry on the same day, the
Cardinal riding alone before His Majesty, preceded by
the three commanders of the army. An enormous convoy
of provisions was a more welcome sight to the wolfish
creatures crowding in their streets full of tragedy and
falling on skeleton knees at Louis XIII.’s feet.</p>

<p>The city, once submissive, was treated severely, but not
barbarously. Richelieu would crush rebels with his whole
strength, but he left men free to practise their own religion,
provided it did not interfere with their obedience to the
State. In this he was consistent: a wiser man than
Louis XIV., he would never have revoked the great Henry’s
edict and deprived France of a multitude of her most
capable citizens. The walls and towers of La Rochelle
were razed to the ground; the city lost her proud self-governing
independence, and became subject to the royal
authority. But an amnesty was offered to the leading
Huguenots, and the Cardinal placed the gallant Guiton,
corsair by nature, in command of one of His Majesty’s
ships.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The Duc de Nevers and the war of the Mantuan Succession—The
rebellion in Languedoc—A new Italian campaign—Richelieu as Commander-in-Chief.</p>

</div>
<p>A few days after the submission of La Rochelle a
great storm destroyed the mole which had been the
city’s destruction. Winds and floods devastated the
west of France, and the Cardinal and the Chancellor were
nearly drowned in crossing the Loire on their journey with
the Court back to Paris.</p>

<p>There was no time for delay. France was on the eve
of a new war; and, though the Huguenot question was not
really settled as long as the Duc de Rohan kept rebellion
stirring in Languedoc, Richelieu felt himself safe in laying
it aside for the moment. Spain and Savoy had attacked
the Duke of Mantua; his fortress of Casale in Montferrat
had been blockaded by Spanish troops for some months
before the fall of La Rochelle, but had held out gallantly
in the hope of relief from France; indeed, a body of
French volunteers had already forced their way in, led by
the Cardinal’s trusted agent, M. de Guron, whom he had
sent from La Rochelle to manage matters with Savoy until
the French were free to act openly.</p>

<p>The difficulty now was that French opinion found itself
deeply divided on the question of Mantua. The new Duke
was Charles de Gonzague, Duc de Nevers, who had
succeeded Vincenzo di Gonzaga as a lineal descendant of
the old family. His succession to Mantua and Montferrat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
was disputed in various quarters and for various reasons.
The Duke of Savoy claimed Montferrat, the Duke of
Guastalla claimed Mantua; Spain would not have a French
prince ruling in Italy, and the Emperor Ferdinand II.
insisted on his right as suzerain to hold the provinces and
to decide the matter.</p>

<p>The Duc de Nevers was one of the greatest nobles in
France. And not only that: he was the head of the house
of Paleologus, and the natural heir, had it still existed,
to the throne of Constantinople. He was a high-minded,
magnificent personage, brave, chivalrous, romantic—Père
Joseph’s intimate friend and fellow-crusader. Under the
regency he had been a disturbing element, and Marie de
Médicis hated him for reasons of her own. In those
days her rage against him had led her to speak scornfully
of his birth and his race.</p>

<p>“Which coming to the Duke’s knowledge,” says M. de
Montglat, “he said that he knew well the respect he owed
her as the mother of his King; but that, on the other hand,
every one was aware that the Gonzagas were princes
before the Medici were gentlemen. These words so piqued
the Queen that she never forgave him.”</p>

<p>Therefore there was a private motive of revenge behind
the strong opposition offered by the Queen-mother and her
friends—the Chancellor Marillac, on this occasion, joining
his voice once more with those of the Cardinal de Bérulle,
the Princesse de Conti and her lover Bassompierre, and all
those of the Court who hated and envied Richelieu—to the
plan of marching at once, with the victorious army of
La Rochelle, to the succour of the Duke of Mantua. They
argued that the troops needed rest after their eighteen
months of hardship; that the Huguenot party was not yet
really crushed and would have time to rise again; that the
Duke of Mantua’s difficulties mattered little in comparison
with a peaceful settlement at home. To these zealous
Catholics it appeared horribly inconsistent that the Pope
should send congratulations and command <i>Te Deums</i>, and
that a Cardinal’s Hat should be bestowed on Alphonse de
Richelieu, now Archbishop of Lyons—a striking departure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
from the precedent which forbade that honour to two
brothers—all this to glorify the conquest of La Rochelle;
while the hero of that conquest was ready and eager to
plunge into war with the Catholic powers, Austria and
Spain.</p>

<p>This was the keenest trial of strength that had yet
taken place between the Queen-mother and her former
<i>protégé</i>. To all her arguments she added those of family
affections and old alliance: the Queen of Spain and the
future Duchess of Savoy were the King’s sisters; peace
with Spain and the Empire had been the chief object of
her own policy as Regent. In reply, Richelieu maintained
his views: the honour of France was concerned in the
Mantuan affair; the Duke’s legitimate right could not be
disputed; and if France were to suffer the pretensions of
Spain, Savoy, and the Empire, she would be acting a part
both cowardly and foolish. Never would Louis XIII.’s
Minister consent thus to degrade his King. The Cardinal
went on to make a statement of his policy and his intentions,
promising that by the month of May Casale would
be relieved and the royal army free to deal with the
Huguenots in Languedoc. “So that your Majesty will, I
hope, return victorious to Paris in the month of August.”
In a more personal strain he reproached the King for want
of confidence, and frankly pointed out, in Marie’s presence,
the faults of character which made him a difficult master
to serve. Then once more he alluded to his own weak
health, and offered to lay down the burden of office, too
heavy, he said, for him to bear.</p>

<p>Marie de Médicis listened, and perhaps, with her eyes
fixed on her gloomy and worried son, hoped for an instant
that the Cardinal’s career was ended. Nothing of the kind.
“When the King had heard all this with as much patience
as the humours of the great generally bestow on the most
important affairs, he told the Cardinal that he was resolved
to profit by what had been said, but would hear no more
of his retirement.”</p>

<p>From this conference, says M. Martin, “Richelieu <i>sortit
roi</i>.” Our point of view shows this as a fact; but neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
the Cardinal himself nor his enemies saw it at the time.
The Queen-mother’s hostility was only now becoming open
and active; the “Day of Dupes,” when Richelieu ran his
greatest risk and reached his zenith of power, was still
almost two years distant.</p>

<p>The King left Paris for the south on January 15, 1629,
travelling through eastern France, while the army of La
Rochelle, under Marshals Schomberg, Bassompierre, and
de Créquy, having “refreshed itself” among the mountains
of Auvergne, marched to join His Majesty in Dauphiné.
Cardinal de Richelieu travelled with the King from Châlons.
On his way from Paris he stopped at Les Caves, near
Nogent-sur-Seine, a country house belonging to his old
friend Claude Bouthillier, then a Secretary of State, afterwards
Surintendant des Finances, the father of young Léon
Bouthillier, Comte de Chavigny, who became Richelieu’s
right hand and was loved by him as a son. At Les Caves
the Cardinal met the Prince de Condé, and conferred with
him as to the crushing of the Huguenots in Languedoc.
But he had room for other thoughts. A letter to M. Bouthillier,
written on leaving Les Caves, is attractive in its
detachment from the whirlpool of politics and war.</p>

<p>“I cannot leave your house to pursue my way,” he
writes, “without thanking you for the good cheer
Madame Bouthillier has bestowed on us; which was such,
that if you had yourself been here you could have added
nothing to it.... Also I must tell you that whereas you
described this house as a farm, it may be called a very
fine and pretty house, leaving nothing to be desired but
the building of a gallery on the left hand of the entrance,
in order to match the right wing....” In a postscript,
the Cardinal advises M. Bouthillier as to the purchase of
a château at Pont-sur-Yonne, where in later years, rich
and beneficent, M. le Surintendant and his wife often
entertained royalty.</p>

<p>A month later found Louis XIII. and his army at the
foot of the Alps, on the frontiers of France and Piedmont.
Some negotiations between Richelieu and the Prince of
Piedmont, the King’s brother-in-law, having ended in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
nothing, the French proceeded to invade Savoyard territory.
It was not an easy matter, in the first days of March, over
mountain paths buried in snow, to reach and to storm
the rocky and barricaded gorge which, beyond Mont
Genèvre on the French side, led to the fortified town of
Susa, the gateway of Piedmont. The whole gorge was
commanded by Spanish and Piedmontese troops, firing
down on the invaders; the Duke of Savoy himself was in
the field.</p>

<p>In the dark hours of early morning, Louis XIII. led
his regiments to the attack. Plunging on foot through
the snow, “freely hazarding his person,” says Aubery,
“and running the same risk as the least soldier in his
army,” the story goes that the victory was largely owing
to his own resolute courage. The marshals in command,
they say, and even the Cardinal, were inclined to hesitate
at an adventure that looked so dangerous. The King
climbed the mountain and met a goatherd, who showed
him a path by which the barricades and their defenders
could be out-flanked. While the main body, under the
marshals, rushed furiously on the barricades and cleared
the gorge at the point of the sword, the royal musketeers
scaled the rocks and drove down the enemy, first to the
barricades, then along the road to Susa. In the helpless
rout of his troops the Duke of Savoy narrowly escaped
being taken prisoner.</p>

<p>A few days were enough to reduce the romantic mountain
town of Susa, and the relief of Casale followed at
once; for the furious energy of the French, acting as one
man under the inspiring force of Richelieu, was too much
for Charles Emmanuel of Savoy. He sent his daughter-in-law
in great magnificence to visit her royal brother
at Susa, and hastily made a treaty with France, of which
he was not long in repenting; but the immediate and
necessary consequence was the retirement from Montferrat
of the Spanish general, Don Gonzalez de Cordova. A
half-promise that Philip IV. of Spain would induce the
Emperor to grant the new Duke of Mantua his desired
investiture was not so easy of fulfilment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>There were diplomatie wheels within wheels. While
Richelieu’s negotiations with Savoy and Spain were still
in progress, Spain was turning a favourable ear to the
Duc de Rohan, who proposed to “keep France in a state
of war as long as His Catholic Majesty pleased”; undertaking
that his party, if successful in establishing a
Protestant republic in the south, should assure liberty
of conscience and the free exercise of their religion to
Catholics, on the condition of a handsome subsidy and
pensions for himself and his brother. This agreement was
actually signed at Madrid on May 3, when Richelieu was
still at Susa, the King and the larger part of the army
having already re-crossed the Alps and marched through
Dauphiné to the Rhône. So far the prophecy had been
fulfilled: the month of May had found the royal forces free
to join Condé, Montmorency and d’Épernon, and thus to
deal with the rebels in Languedoc.</p>

<p>They were not capable of much resistance. The
brothers Rohan and Soubise, with their friends, had no
regular army to oppose the King of France and his fifty
thousand men. A recent treaty between France and
England had deprived them of Charles I.’s possible help,
and Richelieu’s movements were far too quick for Spain.
By the middle of May the royal armies had poured like
a devastating torrent over Languedoc and part of Guienne,
destroying the green crops, the growing corn, all the year’s
food of the strong little towns and villages, and driving
the scattered people to the mountains. Every detail of
the campaign was planned by Richelieu, and it was he
who arranged that the King himself should escape the
early summer heats by crossing the Cévennes to the
Tarn country and carrying out there the general scheme
of destruction.</p>

<p>The first step in the campaign was the decisive one, and
cost more to both sides than all the rest. Privas on its
high ridge, the gallant little stronghold of the Vivarais,
seventeen years earlier the seat of a general Protestant
Synod, was now called upon literally to give its life for the
cause. After a fortnight’s fighting siege, during which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
many lives were lost, the inhabitants and the garrison
insisted that their brave commander, St. André de
Montbrun, should make terms with the King. These were
refused, and the surrender had to be unconditional. Town
and people were treated with terrible severity. Both
besiegers and besieged have been blamed for a furious fire
which broke out as the royal troops were entering the
fortress; in the awful night of confusion and massacre that
followed, Privas was sacked and burnt to the ground with
every circumstance of savagery.</p>

<p>At such times Louis XIII. was hard and inflexible. He
would have hanged St. André, had not the Cardinal intervened
to save him. Indeed, on this occasion and others,
Richelieu showed a humanity for which most writers have
given him little credit. Towards political offenders he was
indeed “the Iron Cardinal”—no mercy for those who came
in the way of his great designs; but he had pity on the
helpless fugitives of Privas.</p>

<p>He was ill in bed on the fatal night of May 29. “But
in spite of his illness,” writes Aubery, “having mounted
his horse with two hundred gentlemen, he went himself
to meet the crowd of inhabitants who had forsaken
their homes and their goods; and among others he saved
twelve young girls from sixteen to eighteen years old,
caused them to be led in safety to the Château d’Autremont,
and recommended them with much charity to the Lady of
that place, who took great care of them. Afterwards one
brought to him an infant of seven months, found in the
arms of his dead mother; and having praised and rewarded
the soldier for saving from among the dead him who had
but begun to live, he gave the child a nurse, and commanded
that he should be well brought up and should be called
Fortunat de Privas....”</p>

<p>That such actions should be remembered as exceptional,
only proves what was then the usual fate of wretched non-combatants.
The well-known horrors of the Thirty Years
War, then raging in Germany, soon to be shared in by
France, are witness enough. Compared with Tilly and
Mansfeldt in their campaigns of mercenary ravage and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
slaughter, Richelieu’s dealings with the Huguenot faction
appear, considering all things, actually gentle.</p>

<p>After the taking of Privas, the royal armies swept the
south with little difficulty. One after another the towns
and fortified villages opened their gates and laid down their
arms, and when the King made his triumphal entry into
Nîmes, early in July, Richelieu had attained the first great
end of his policy; the Huguenot “state within the State”
had practically ceased to exist.</p>

<p>The Duc de Rohan and the Protestants of the south,
once conquered, were treated with moderation. A general
amnesty was offered: Rohan retired to Venice, a free man.
Liberty of conscience was assured by the confirmation of
the Edict of Nantes. The one severe condition was the
razing of all the Huguenot fortifications throughout the
provinces. This had to be accepted and carried out, sorely
against the will of the many proud little towns and village
strongholds scattered through the mountains and valleys
of that stern country, which now found themselves tame
and defenceless under the power of the Crown. Only one
town, Montauban of fighting memory, stood out and refused
to destroy the walls and towers that were her glory and
pride. She refused so obstinately that the King, tired of
his hot campaign, began his journey back to Paris on
July 15, leaving the Cardinal, himself ill of fever, to bring
her to reason.</p>

<p>This he did with such success, after two or three weeks
of argument, the Montauban deputies following him from
town to town, that they at last consented to swallow the
bitter pill of complete submission. In the middle of August
he entered Montauban peaceably with a strong force, and
was received with almost royal honours and specially
harangued by the Protestant ministers. After lingering
a few days to see the destruction of the ramparts well
begun, “il retourna triomphant à Paris, au grand crève-cœur
de ses ennemis.”</p>

<p>But those enemies were increasing in number, strength,
and confidence. The chances seemed far more even to
lookers-on of that day than to us, who possess the balances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
of history. The reigning Queen, the Queen-mother, Monsieur,
all the princes of the blood except Condé—Alexandre
de Vendôme had died at Vincennes in the early spring of
1629, and his family held Richelieu responsible—most of
the great nobles and ladies of the Court; statesmen such
as Michel de Marillac; Marshals of France such as his
brother Louis, lately promoted to that rank, Bassompierre,
and others; ecclesiastics such as the Cardinal de Bérulle—all
these, openly or secretly, for personal or political reasons,
were opposed to Richelieu. He had his hearty adherents,
the followers of his star, but they were few and rather
clever than powerful. His only real support was the King.
And Louis XIII. showed considerable strength of character
in standing by his Minister against such odds, social and
religious.</p>

<p>Arriving victorious at Fontainebleau, Richelieu was
received with angry coldness by Marie de Médicis. He
had not only carried out the policy she hated as to Mantua,
Spain, and Savoy, but he had shown the rebel Huguenots
what seemed to her a scandalous toleration. A furious
jealousy of his influence with the King was so evident a
motive of her rage, that the Cardinal found it politic to bow
before the storm.</p>

<p>Once more he solemnly offered his resignation to the
King; once more Louis, torn between the claims of his
mother and his Minister, having spent a day in tears, refused
to receive it. On the contrary, he heaped fresh honours on
the Cardinal. By letters patent he became “chief Minister
of State,” the first time in French history that such an
appointment had been formally made. A kind of peace
was patched up with the Queen-mother. She and her
friends only bided their time; the death of Cardinal de
Bérulle, a few days after Richelieu’s return from the south,
removed one of the best of her counsellors and left her
more completely in the hands of a violent faction.</p>

<p>Now, in the autumn, the Duke of Mantua found himself
again in a desperate plight. The Emperor Ferdinand,
victorious over the Protestants of the north, turned to
revenge the check that France had given to his feudal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
authority and to the armies of Spain. The unlucky
Grisons found their country once more overrun, this
time by an imperial army under Marshal Colalto, which
descended the Val Tellina and stormed across the Lombard
plain to the siege of Mantua, very slightly hindered by
a Venetian force which had come to the Duke’s aid. At
the same time the valiant old Marquis Spinola, the Spanish
governor of Milan, invaded Montferrat and again besieged
Casale, where M. de Toiras, the hero of the Isle of Ré,
was now in command.</p>

<p>It looked as if the French were to lose all advantages
gained by their brilliant spring campaign. The whole
aspect of affairs was alarming, for the danger was not
only that which the Duke of Mantua’s imploring letters
pressed upon the King. Imperial armies were massing
on the eastern frontier of France, threatening Champagne,
and it was necessary that a French force should be sent
to watch them. The Duke of Lorraine’s loyalty was
uncertain. It cannot have been without misgivings that
Richelieu placed that gate of the kingdom in charge of
his suspected enemy Louis de Marillac, with Monsieur,
the light and treacherous, in nominal chief command.</p>

<p>As to himself, he left Court intrigues behind him, left
his master to the persuasions of men and women who
hated him, and accepted the royal commission of “Lieutenant-Général
de là les Monts,” which not only gave
him the supreme command of the new Italian campaign,
but made him the actual representative of Royalty in all
matters political and military. No Constable of France
had ever reached such a height of delegated power.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock in the morning of December 29 he took
leave, says Aubery, of the King and the Queens at the
Louvre. “He then dined in the chamber of Madame
de Combalet, his niece, then lady-in-waiting to the
Queen-mother, and towards three o’clock in the afternoon
he mounted into his coach, having with him the
Cardinal de la Valette and the Duc de Montmorency,
who were both at one <i>portière</i>, and the Maréchaux de
Bassompierre and de Schomberg at the other. Outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
the gates of the Louvre he was joined by a troop of a
hundred cavaliers, all men of rank, who accompanied him
for half a league outside the city, where his train and his
guards awaited him.... Thus he took his way, in the
depth of winter, to carry succour to Montferrat, leaving
the Court and Paris in a season whose rigour is particularly
felt in the open country.”</p>

<p>Letters written by the Cardinal from Lyons show how
his thoughts lingered behind at Paris, among the enemies
and friends he had left there. Having obtained a piece
of the True Cross from the Célestins at Avignon, he sent
it, with a letter, to Marie de Médicis, by the hands of his
niece, her lady-in-waiting. Enclosed with the treasure
was a confidential letter to Madame de Combalet—one of
his three friends in Marie’s household, the other two being
his cousin Charles de la Meilleraye, captain of the guard,
and Denys Bouthillier de Rancé, private secretary—asking
her to beg from Her Majesty the favour of three lines
in her own hand, to be shown to those who made it
their business to inquire if she had written to him. Such
lines would be of more value, he says, than whole sheets
from the secretary, “qui est bon pour d’autres, mais non
pour une antienne créature.”</p>

<p>The odd touch of something like sentiment, appealing to
the Queen’s memory, seems to justify what has been said
of the great Cardinal—that he did not understand women.
It looks as if he had persuaded himself that the recent
reconciliation would be lasting, that Marie had forgotten
her grudges and might be expected, in his interest, to
silence the curious and the impertinent.</p>

<p>A campaign against Germany and Spain sounded
formidable, but in fact it resolved itself into a duel between
Cardinal de Richelieu and the Duke of Savoy. That
cunning old prince did not at once break through the
Treaty of Susa, which bound him to take the French
side in case the Duke of Mantua was again attacked by
Spain; but he did his best, by every device in his power,
to hinder the march of the French army. The danger did
indeed become less immediate; plague, fever, and floods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
forced Marshal Colalto to retire from Mantua, and M. de
Toiras held his own in Casale. Even before Richelieu
had crossed the mountains, the Pope’s intervention brought
about some talk of peace, while Charles Emmanuel made
endless difficulties as to the terms on which the French,
to gain Montferrat, should pass through the territories
of Savoy.</p>

<p>But all these delays only made Richelieu more resolute
and more impatient. He descended into Dauphiné, swept
an army over the Alps in terrible weather, and took up
his quarters at Susa, still in French hands. Charles
Emmanuel continued the game he was playing with both
sides; the Cardinal soon knew that while negotiating
with him as to joint action against Spain the Duke was
in communication with the Spanish and imperial commanders,
was trying to make sure of the passes behind
the French army, and was delaying the supplies purchased
with French gold for Casale. The Duke seemed, in fact,
to hold the key of the situation.</p>

<p>This state of things did not last long. It may be said
that when the Marquis du Chillou exchanged sword for
crosier France lost a great field-marshal; yet it is only
partly true. Over and over again Richelieu the soldier
proved himself the match in genius, will, and spirit of
Richelieu the cardinal and statesman. The conqueror of
La Rochelle was now fully equal to the difficult campaign
forced upon him by the disloyal movements of the Duke
of Savoy.</p>

<p>Instead of crossing the frontier into Montferrat, to the
immediate relief of Casale, Richelieu marched his 22,000
men on Rivoli, where his false ally, with his sons and the
armed forces of Savoy, lay in wait to command the French
rear. At the news of this advance, Duke and princes,
Savoyards and Piedmontese, fled back pell-mell to Turin.</p>

<p>It was one of the picturesque moments in Richelieu’s
life. At the dawn of a March day, under torrents of rain
and hail, he forded the swollen river Dora at the head of
his cavalry. The infantry crossed by a narrow bridge.
Horse and foot were alike in a bad humour, after many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
days of forced marches in terrible weather by mountain
and plain. They cursed their leader freely enough as he
splashed through the ford and caracoled on the farther
bank, armed to the teeth and escorted by pages and guards.
Little trace of the ecclesiastic in that handsome general
officer, his worn face under a feathered hat, a steel cuirass
on his body, ready to share in all the hardships of his
discontented men. In his <i>Memoirs</i> Richelieu has nothing
but good to say of the soldiers, whose insolence, according
to others, vexed him at the time. “The poor soldiers did
their duty gaily,” he writes. But the next day all grievances
were forgotten. In snug quarters at Rivoli, drinking
the Duke of Savoy’s good wine and devouring his stores,
the men were shouting merrily, “Vive le grand Cardinal de
Richelieu!”</p>

<p>He was too wise to advance against Spain and Austria,
leaving Savoy and Piedmont to attack him in the rear. His
next move really decided the war. He swept back towards
the mountains, took Pinerolo after a short siege, and seized
on several strong frontier places, the gateways of the Alps
between Dauphiné and Piedmont. Once more, as in earlier
centuries, “France held the keys of Italy.”</p>

<p>The war dragged on through the summer; its history
must be read elsewhere. The Court moved to Lyons, and
Richelieu met the King at Grenoble early in May. Together,
in a short and easy campaign, they conquered
Savoy. Chambéry opened its gates on May 15.</p>

<p>The extreme unhealthiness of the season—plague raging
in Northern Italy—prevented Louis from personally
taking the command of his Italian army. From St. Jean
de Maurienne he and the Cardinal watched the course of
events, while sending the Duc de Montmorency across
Mont Cenis with troops to reinforce the marshals in
command at Pinerolo. The combined armies made fresh
conquests and behaved magnificently; but the great heat
and the ravages of disease were enemies as formidable as
Spaniards and Imperialists, who on their side held doggedly
to their objects and gained at least one tremendous success.
The storming of Mantua by the Emperor’s troops on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
night of July 17 was a crime against civilisation. Art
treasures never to be replaced were lost and destroyed in
the sack of the old Gonzaga palace on its gleaming lake,
a shrine of Renaissance beauty since the days of Isabella
d’Este.</p>

<p>Immediately after this catastrophe Charles Emmanuel
of Savoy died of despair at the loss of his towns and
provinces. His son, the husband of Madame Christine of
France, was more alive to the wisdom of an alliance with
Louis XIII. An obstacle was thus removed from the path
of the peace negotiations, which went on in spite of active
war all through the summer and the early autumn; the
chief agents in them being Père Joseph, at the Diet of
Ratisbon, and a young Italian diplomat in the service of
the Pope, named Giulio Mazarini.</p>

<p>When, late in October, the war ended with the retirement
of the Austrians and Spaniards, the relief of Casale,
and the restoration of Mantua to Duke Charles, it seemed
as if Richelieu’s triumphs abroad and at home were signal
and complete. And yet, at this very time, he was on the
edge of destruction.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Illness of Louis XIII.—“Le Grand Orage de la Cour”—The “Day
of Dupes.”</p>

</div>
<p>Louis XIII., always weak in health, suffered seriously
from the pestilential air of that summer. In August
he rejoined the Court at Lyons, where he fell ill
of fever and dysentery, and the Cardinal, hurrying back
from Savoy, found his royal master almost in extremity.
By the end of September, after seven bleedings in one
week, the case was given up as hopeless. Louis received
the last Sacraments, the whole Court believed him dying,
and a swift courier summoned Gaston d’Orléans from
Paris. That “blind and frivolous instrument of the enemies
of the State” became suddenly a personage of the very
highest importance.</p>

<p>Richelieu, as he watched his dying master, was probably
the most deeply troubled man in all the distracted Court.
“He saw,” writes M. Martin, “his power crumbling, his
life threatened, his work, even dearer to him than life—his
work, hardly sketched out, on the brink of destruction,
his country falling back into the abyss from which he
had raised her.”</p>

<p>He was indeed in imminent danger. His enemies, the
Queen-mother in chief, flattered themselves that his fate
was at last in their hands. The King’s death was to be
the signal for his arrest. In the meanwhile, Marie held
counsel with her friends as to what should be done with
him. All, according to tradition, held different opinions.
Some condemned him to death, and among these, to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
own undoing, was the Maréchal de Marillac. Some were
for lifelong imprisonment; the mildest talked of perpetual
exile. The story goes that Richelieu, the omniscient,
always well served by spies and himself ready to play
the part on occasion, listened to the debate through a
chink hidden by tapestry. Further, that there came a
day when each of his enemies met the fate he had recommended
for the Cardinal.</p>

<p>Louis XIII. was well aware of the danger in which his
death would leave his most distinguished servant. He
respected Richelieu, even if he had not, in his own queer
way, a kind of affection for him. At this crisis he sent
for the Duc de Montmorency—with all his faults, one
of the most generous and chivalrous of Frenchmen—and
commended the Cardinal to his protection. It seems that
Montmorency had already offered it, with a safe refuge
in his government of Languedoc. These facts added
bitterness to the terrible events of two years later.</p>

<p>Montmorency’s kindness was not needed. An internal
abscess broke, and the King began to recover. But the
Cardinal’s position was far from safe. During days of
weary convalescence, the tender nursing of Louis’ mother
and his wife gained for them a new and strong influence
over his mind. Perhaps Queen Anne’s hatred of the
Cardinal was even more thorough-going than that of her
mother-in-law; and she had more power to injure him,
if the malicious Court gossip of the day is at all based
on facts. Had he really made love to her, in his awkward
and pedantic fashion? It is only fair to say that M. Avenel,
his most thorough and careful student, could find not one
line of certain evidence for any of the stories of this kind
that were told against him.</p>

<p>However, the voices of the two women prevailed so
far that Louis, weak and exhausted, made them a kind
of conditional promise. He could not dispense with his
Minister while the war in Italy still went on. Let that
be successfully ended—and then, possibly, he might see
his way towards ending Richelieu’s career.</p>

<p>With this prospect in view, the Queen-mother waited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
patiently. When the news of peace arrived, the Court
had just accomplished its journey, made chiefly by river,
from Lyons to Paris, and it was noticed by the way
that Her Majesty accepted the Cardinal’s company and
respectful attention, treating him, apparently, with all
her former confidence. It seemed to ignorant spectators
only natural that she should celebrate the relief of Casale,
the end of the war, with bonfires and fireworks: the
Princesse de Conti hardly needed her frank explanation:
“It is not at the Duke of Mantua’s good luck, but at
the Cardinal’s ruin, that I rejoice.”</p>

<p>But the <i>feux de joie</i> blazed too soon. Marie found that
her son, restored to health and victorious, was not quite
ready to dismiss the genius to whom his kingdom owed
so much. It was a bitter disappointment. Marie held
her more violent feelings in check, listened perforce to
the King’s assurances of Richelieu’s loyalty, and consented
to meet him on the royal Council as usual. She was
even prepared for a formal reconciliation with her “antienne
créature,” to be sealed by receiving back Madame de
Combalet into the service and favour from which she
had been dismissed some months before.</p>

<p>But here Marie’s dissembling ended; and on November 9,
1630, with a burst of feminine fury, began that “grand
orage de la Cour” which threatened to break Armand
de Richelieu in full upward flight: the man already feared
by Catholic Europe and the hope of the northern Protestants,
with whose new leader, Gustavus Adolphus of
Sweden, his diplomacy was even now allying France.</p>

<p>Madame de Combalet appeared that morning at the
Luxembourg, and was received by the Queen-mother and
the King in all the splendour of the new palace, with
its silver-framed windows, its walls and ceilings decorated
by great artists, already the admiration of Europe. Madame
de Combalet herself was made for Courts, though she
disliked and despised them. Still young and very handsome,
her quiet dignity was at home anywhere: in the
Carmelite convent from which all her uncle’s persuasion
and authority had hardly withdrawn her; at the head of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
his house; or, as now, at the feet of frowning Royalty.
On her knees she made the Queen a polite and respectful
speech, begging to be restored to favour. At first Marie
was stiff and cold; then she became angry; then, as rage
got the better of her ponderous temperament, she forgot
all her promises and poured out on the unlucky lady
such a torrent of abuse and insult that Louis himself
stepped forward, gave his hand to Madame de Combalet,
and asked her to retire. A nervous, sensitive woman, it
was no wonder that she left the presence in floods of tears.</p>

<p>The Cardinal, arriving by appointment for his own
audience of reconciliation, met his niece at the door. The
sight of her face was so sharp a warning that he hesitated,
we are told, before passing on. In the meanwhile the
Queen-mother was assuring her son that she had not
changed her mind: her reception of the Cardinal would
be all he could desire. This was an affair of State; the
disgrace of a useless creature like la Combalet could
signify to no one.</p>

<p>If Marie believed in her own intention, she reckoned
without her passionate temper. It is true that she received
the Cardinal with tolerable graciousness, but many minutes
had not passed before her tone changed for the worse.
“Peu à peu, la marée monte”: the rising tide of anger.
Richelieu heard himself called an ungrateful, perfidious
knave, a traitor to his King and country. The Queen-mother
refused to sit with him any more on the Council.
Along with Madame de Combalet, La Meilleraye, and
Denys Bouthillier, he was roughly dismissed from her
service—he still held his old charge of superintendent of
her household. He might go, she said at last, and never
willingly would she look upon his face again.</p>

<p>Richelieu listened quietly. He attempted no useless
prayer or argument, but bowed, and went.</p>

<p>There was something of a scene between Louis XIII.
and his mother. Marie justified herself with success, as it
seemed to her, solemnly assuring the King that Richelieu
was in every way false to him; that his secret ambition
was “to marry his niece to the Comte de Soissons and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
make the Comte King.” These and many more accusations
she poured into the sullen ears of her son. Let him be
rid of this evil man, this terrible Minister, the ruin of
France! Let him put his trust in faithful servants such
as the brothers Marillac. With Michel as First Minister
and Louis as Commander-in-chief, the safety and honour
of France would be assured. But before all things let
him keep his promise and be rid of Richelieu.</p>

<p>A stronger man than Louis XIII. would have found
the position a difficult one. He had to choose between
his mother—on whose side were his wife, his brother,
nearly all the Court and half the kingdom—and the
Minister whose personal influence over him was considerable,
and on whom, as reason told him, the greatness
of France, both within and without, now very largely
depended. Duty to his mother, duty to his country—Louis XIII.
had a conscience, and it was torn in two.</p>

<p>He was lodging at the Hôtel des Ambassadeurs, in the
Rue de Tournon—once Concini’s house, sacked by the
mob in 1616—for he had come up from Versailles to visit
the Queen-mother, and the Louvre was under repair. He
walked back from the Luxembourg, shut himself into his
room with his gentleman-in-waiting, Saint-Simon—a wise
young man whom Richelieu, luckily for himself, had
appointed to the post—tore the buttons off his coat in
a violent fit of nerves, and flung himself on the bed.</p>

<p>Presently he poured out his worried soul to Saint-Simon.
What did he think of the Queen-mother’s conduct,
and of the whole affair? The young man was very discreet;
but he reminded the King that he was a king, as
well as a son, and ventured to give his opinion that “the
Cardinal was necessary to France.” “Enfin, sire, vous
êtes le maître.” “Yes, I am,” said Louis, “and they shall
feel it.”</p>

<p>The next day—Sunday, November 10, St. Martin’s Eve—Louis
went again to the Luxembourg. He was resolved,
it seems, to have his way, and to persuade or command
his mother to change her mind. Bassompierre attended
him to the palace, and gives some vivid details of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
interview in the Queen’s cabinet, although neither he nor
any other courtier was present. He says that while the
King and his mother were talking, all the doors being
carefully shut, “Monsieur le Cardinal arrived; who, finding
the door of the ante-chamber fastened, entered the gallery
and knocked at the door of the cabinet, but no one replied.
At length, impatient of waiting, knowing the ways of the
house, he passed through the little chapel, the door of
which had not been closed: thus M. le Cardinal entered
the cabinet. The King was somewhat astonished, and
said to the Queen with dismay: ‘Here he is.’ M. le
Cardinal, who perceived their astonishment, said to them:
‘I am sure you were talking of me.’ The Queen answered
him: ‘We were not.’ On which he having replied to her,
‘Confess it, madame,’ she said it was so, and upon that
spoke against him with great sharpness, declaring that
she would have no more to do with him, and many other
things.”</p>

<p>Richelieu preserved his sphinx-like patience. To Marie’s
insults and reproaches he answered not a word; but he
realized that he was in danger, and he did his best to
soften the angry woman by pleading for himself, even
with tears—which, says an enemy, he had at command—declaring
his innocence and his entire devotion to Her
Majesty.</p>

<p>The Queen, on her side, wept passionately, crying out
that all he said and did was knavery and mummery. Then,
turning to her son, she asked him if he preferred “un
valet” to his mother; for he must choose between them
two.</p>

<p>“Then it is only natural that I should be sacrificed,”
said the Cardinal; and immediately, once more, he offered
his resignation to the troubled King, begging to be allowed
to retire to some place where he might end his days in
repose.</p>

<p>To all appearance Louis accepted his resignation and
granted his request, even advising him to retire to Pontoise.
Cardinal de Richelieu left the palace and went back to his
hôtel, the Petit-Luxembourg—the Palais-Cardinal, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
in progress, was not yet finished—with every reason to
believe himself a disgraced and ruined man.</p>

<p>It is not likely that Louis really intended to part with
his Minister. But it was touch-and-go. He had gained
time by pacifying his mother for the moment, and had
thought to do wisely by removing the hated object from
her sight. His next step was to send envoys to reason
and negotiate at the Luxembourg. Père Suffren, the royal
confessor, and Cardinal Bagni, the Pope’s Nuncio, both did
their best, but absolutely in vain. At the moment of her
suddenly snatched triumph, Marie de Médicis was not
likely to listen to them. Early the next morning the King
hurried back to his hunting-lodge at Versailles. It looked
as though his promises of four years ago had been mere
waste of breath and of paper, for he had not seen Richelieu
again. With regard to the two Marillacs, he had
seemingly obeyed his mother. Michel, as Minister, was
summoned to follow His Majesty to Versailles, and a courier
rode off post-haste for Italy, carrying despatches which
appointed Louis to the chief command of the army.</p>

<p>This was St. Martin’s Day, Monday, November 11, the
“Journée des Dupes.”</p>

<p>News of the Cardinal’s fall spread swiftly through Paris.
The Parisians did not love him: his good work in improving
the city, carrying on the additions to the Louvre,
building a new bridge, rebuilding the Sorbonne at his own
cost, was counterbalanced by acts of tyranny. Citizens
had been more or less forced to sell their houses, vegetable
gardens had been seized, a part of the old wall of Charles V.
had been destroyed, all to make room for the Palais-Cardinal.
On that Monday morning all Paris, high and
low, courtiers and <i>canaille</i>, ran in crowds to the Luxembourg
to congratulate the Queen-mother on her victory.
In and round the palace the crush of the dupes was so
great that there was no room to move. Marie, the centre
of it, saw herself once more a ruler in France, her son
submissive, her faithful friends rewarded, her enemy
ruined and exiled. Some wise man advised her to make
assurance sure by following the King to Versailles; she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
laughed the counsellor away. Why hide in the woods
when there was so much to be done in the city?—ambassadors
sending couriers half over Europe; joyful
meetings with Queen Anne, with Monsieur; audiences of
great lords and ladies, one by one; all the happy, noisy,
popular confusion of a sudden return to power.</p>

<p>Close by, at the Petit-Luxembourg, Richelieu had his
moment of despair. To fall from so great a height meant
death, at least to all his ambitions; perhaps literally, for
his enemies, so many and so strong, would hardly be
satisfied with exile. And he knew the nature of the
King. Held by his own strong influence, all was well,
but Louis was too nervous to endure such scenes as those
of the last few days, if by any possible sacrifice he could
end them. Richelieu might be the victim of the King’s
hatred of worry as much as of the Queen-mother’s hatred
of himself.</p>

<p>Several far-seeing men had the courage to separate
themselves from the crowd pressing to the greater Luxembourg.
One of these was the Cardinal de la Valette, the
ugly, generous, soldierly second son of the Duc d’Épernon;
another, the Marquis de Châteauneuf, a distinguished
Councillor of State, afterwards ruined by his passion for
Madame de Chevreuse; another, that worthy man the
Marquis de Rambouillet, whose wife had for some years
reigned over half society from her hôtel near the Louvre.
These good friends, with a few others, would not allow
Richelieu to despair. Though his papers were packed and
his coach was ordered for the journey to Pontoise, they
entreated him not to go. Cardinal de la Valette reminded
him of the old proverb, “Qui quitte la partie la perd,” and
gave the advice—to wiser ears than the Queen’s—that he
should follow his royal master to Versailles, on the pretext
of bidding him farewell. In the midst of their discussion
some one arrived from Versailles with a verbal message
from Saint-Simon, advising the same course. This strong
and direct encouragement had a marvellous effect on
Richelieu’s depressed spirits. “Transported with joy, he
kissed the messenger on both cheeks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>No time was lost, we may well believe. The Cardinal’s
coach rumbled out of Paris, but his horses’ heads were
turned to the south-west, not to the north. In a long
private interview with the King he regained all he had
seemed to lose, and took a final and solid hold on power.
The courtiers, being admitted, heard from the King’s own
lips that he ordered the Cardinal to remain with him,
serving him well as before; “that he would find means to
appease his mother and to gain her consent to what he
did, while removing from her those persons who gave her
pernicious counsel.”</p>

<p>The Cardinal was treated in a princely manner and
lodged in the château, a special mark of favour in days
when Versailles was only a small country-house in the
midst of immense forests. From his lodging, the next day,
he wrote several letters. One was to the King, expressing
his extreme satisfaction and extraordinary gratitude, assuring
him that never was servant so devoted to his master’s
glory, declaring to His Majesty “que je suis la plus fidèle
créature, le plus passionné sujet, et le plus zélé serviteur
que jamais roy et maître ait eu au monde. Je vivray et
finiray en cet estat, comme estant cent fois plus à Vostre
Majesté qu’à moy-mesme....”</p>

<p>He also wrote to his sister, the Marquise de Brézé, and
to his uncle, Amador de la Porte. Knowing that “common
report often represents things as other than they are,” he
first tells the news of his disgrace with the Queen-mother,
who finds his own services, those of his niece de Combalet
and of his cousin La Meilleraye, no longer agreeable to her.
But he begs his sister and his uncle not to be amazed or
afflicted by this misfortune, since it arose from no fault;
and also because he has the consolation of the King’s
presence and favour. To the old Commander, irritable and
garrulous, he adds a word of discreet counsel. “As I am
not capable of any other desire than to live and die the
Queen’s servant, I pray you always to speak conformably
to this. I warn you, knowing your freedom of speech, and
that you might be carried away by the affection you bear
me. It would not be reasonable that all my obligations to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
so good a princess should be forgotten because personally
I now disgust her.”</p>

<p>He could afford to appear magnanimous. Even as he
wrote the news was flying to Paris, not only of his triumph,
but of the utter discomfiture of the Queen-mother’s party
and the ruin of her friends. Michel de Marillac, the Chancellor,
had been arrested and deprived of the seals, which
were given to the Marquis de Châteauneuf. The courier
who conveyed the news of his high appointment to the
Maréchal de Marillac was followed at once by another,
bearing the King’s command that the Maréchal de Schomberg
should arrest him. On the very evening of St. Martin’s
Day, well named “Day of Dupes,” Richelieu’s swift vengeance
was already overtaking his enemies. A few hours
later Marie de Médicis was alone in her deserted Luxembourg.
Courtiers and <i>canaille</i> were rushing to meet the
King’s coach as he drove into Paris, with Cardinal de
Richelieu at his <i>portière</i>.</p>

Montmorency and Monsieur’s ride to Languedoc—Castelnaudary—The

</div>

<p>A few months were enough to rid Cardinal de
Richelieu of his most active enemies. One after
another, in the first half of the year 1631, they
disappeared from the scene by exile or imprisonment, in
some cases ending in death.</p>

<p>After the crushing disappointment of the “Day of Dupes,”
Marie de Médicis submitted to a kind of reconciliation with
her “former creature” who had so convincingly proved
his strength. Gaston d’Orléans too, led by his favourites,
M. de Puylaurens and Président Le Coigneux, whom
Richelieu thought it worth while to bribe heavily, visited
the Cardinal and promised him his friendship. But it was
not to be expected that either mother or son should be in
earnest. Gaston hardly needed the discontent of his favourites—eager
for places and honours which the Cardinal was
not in a hurry to give—to throw him once more into violent
opposition.</p>

<p>On January 30, attended by a dozen gentlemen, the
young Prince appeared at the Petit-Luxembourg. He told
the Cardinal “that he had come to retract the promise of
friendship which he had given him a few days before; on
the contrary, to declare his resentment that a man of his
sort should so far have forgotten himself as to set the royal
family in a blaze. That, owing his whole fortune and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
elevation to the Queen his benefactress, instead of proving
his gratitude, as a good man and a faithful servant would
have done, he had become her chief persecutor, by his
artifices continually blackening her in the eyes of the King;
and that as to himself, he had treated him not only without
respect, but with insolence! And that he would have
reproved him sooner, had he not been restrained by his
quality as a priest; but that this would not save him in the
future from the quite extraordinary treatment deserved
by the gravity of his offences against personages of such
dignity.”</p>

<p>“This discourse,” continues the chronicler, “was made
with so much heat and such threatening gestures of hands
and eyes, that the Cardinal made no answer, not knowing
whether it was all in earnest or only meant to frighten
him.”</p>

<p>The moment was alarming enough, for Monsieur’s
people, so fierce were their looks, seemed to be waiting
their moment to fall upon their prey. The Prince went
down to his coach in a terrible humour, swearing and
threatening all the way, while the Cardinal attended him
bare-headed and prudently silent. It was not till the
blustering company had driven off that he regained his
usual composure. None the less, we are assured, he was
extremely glad to see the King, who came dashing “à toute
bride” to the door, as his champion and protector, not
many minutes later.</p>

<p>Monsieur left Paris immediately for Orléans, where he
swaggered for some weeks and tried to rouse a civil war by
posing as a friend to the populace and a resister of taxation.
Since he refused to submit to his brother and to return to
Court, Richelieu was prepared to bring him to his senses
by armed force. But he preferred self-banishment. In the
middle of March he rode across country to Besançon, and
then took refuge with the Duke of Lorraine. He was
followed into exile by a number of persons of quality,
notably his half-brother the Comte de Moret, the Duc
d’Elbeuf, brother-in-law of the Duc de Vendôme, the Duc
de Bellegarde, governor of Burgundy, and M. and Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
du Fargis, in disgrace at Court because of their intimate
friendship with the brothers Marillac.</p>

<p>Each day of that winter and spring brought fresh and
painful experience to Marie de Médicis. She saw herself
checked in every direction by an enemy who worked with
extraordinary prudence, keeping all the outward forms of
due respect while he lured her gradually to ruin. No
doubt her presence in Paris, her atmosphere of plot and
intrigue, was dangerous to him, if not to the State. The
question was, how to remove her from the centre of things
without a public scandal.</p>

<p>In February the Court went to Compiègne for hunting,
and to spend the Carnival. As Richelieu had foreseen,
the Queen-mother was not deterred by “the incommodity
of the season” from following the King: she would not
repeat her mistake of St. Martin’s Day. At Compiègne
the King made a last unsuccessful attempt to soften her
heart towards the Cardinal. As she firmly refused to
listen to any arguments, it was decided that she must
be separated from a Court in which her presence was
a centre for the factious and the ill-intentioned.</p>

<p>The Château of Compiègne was roused early on the
morning of February 23. The King had announced that
he would go hunting at dawn; and in fact he and the
Cardinal, with a large attendance, rode out of the gates
before either of the Queens was awake. Instead of turning
into the dim glades of the forest, the royal party rode hard
for Paris.</p>

<p>Père Suffren, the Maréchal d’Estrées—formerly known
as Marquis de Coenores—and a Secretary of State, M. de la
Ville-aux-Clercs, were left behind with the King’s apologies
and farewells to his mother, whom he never saw again.
They were also entrusted with a letter, begging Her Majesty
to retire to Moulins, where she might live in all honour and
liberty as governor of the Bourbonnais; it being understood
that in her present mind she was no longer welcome at
Court. This very unpleasant news was broken to Marie
before she left her bed, not by the appointed messengers,
but by Queen Anne, her daughter-in-law, who paid her a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
hurried visit before following the King, and parted from her
with embraces and tears. “Both,” says Madame de Motteville,
“were deeply moved at finding themselves the victims
of the Cardinal de Richelieu, their common enemy. It was
the last time they saw each other.”</p>

<p>As to Moulins, Marie would have none of it. She could
not openly refuse to obey the King, but her excuses
dragged on from day to day: bad roads and wintry
weather; an epidemic in the Bourbonnais; the ruinous
state of the Château de Moulins; a severe cold which kept
her in her room. All the spring royal messengers were
galloping between Compiègne and Paris. Sometimes they
carried persuasion, sometimes threats. If the Queen-mother
disliked the Bourbonnais, would she accept her
old abode of Angers, with the government of Anjou? Let
her remember that no law in Holy Scripture obliged a son
to live always with his mother when of age to govern
himself, whereas we are enjoined in divers places to obey
the King, as God’s lieutenant on earth. And many more
arguments; but in short, her disobedience was insupportable,
and would in the end force the King to treat her more
rigorously.</p>

<p>It appeared that of her own free will she would never
leave Compiègne. In spite of the great courtesy shown
her by M. d’Estrées, in command of the guard—every
morning he came to her for the pass-word, and every
night offered her the keys of the town—she treated herself
as a prisoner. As the season advanced, though free of all
the country round, she never went beyond the castle walls,
hoping thus, says Aubery, to excite general hatred against
the Cardinal.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile her friends disappeared one by one.
Her physician, Vautier, was flung into the Bastille; the
same fate befell the unlucky Bassompierre. The Duc
de Guise, intriguing for Monsieur, his stepson-in-law, in
his government of Provence, was forced to fly to Italy,
a lifelong exile as it proved. The Princesse de Conti,
the Duchesse d’Elbeuf (Henriette de Vendôme), the
Duchesse de Roannez, the Maréchale d’Ornano, and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
great ladies, were ordered to retire to their country
houses; and the brilliant Princesse de Conti, sister of
Guise, the Queen-mother’s constant friend, adored by
Bassompierre, to whom they say she was secretly married,
died at Eu of a broken heart on the last day of April.</p>

<p>In June a report reached the Queen-mother at Compiègne
that a royal army was to be sent to remove her
by force. If this story was invented with the object of
driving her out of the kingdom, it served its end. On
July 18, at ten o’clock at night, she left Compiègne on
foot and almost alone—an easier escape than that from
the Château de Blois. A coach and six, with outriders,
was waiting in the shadow of the forest. The Queen
intended to stop at La Capelle, a small strong place in
Picardy, close to the frontier of the Low Countries: the
governor, M. de Vardes, had promised to receive her. But
this coming to Richelieu’s ears, the father of M. de Vardes,
who had formerly commanded at La Capelle, was sent
post-haste from Paris to supersede his son, and the gates
were shut against the fugitive Queen. She was thus
obliged to cross the frontier, which she did, never to
return; and was received with great honour at Avesnes
in Artois, by the officers of the Archduchess Isabel.</p>

<p>So the great Henry’s Florentine widow removed herself
from the path of Cardinal de Richelieu; to his advantage
and her own loss and ruin.</p>

<p>This political triumph was followed by new honours and
personal dignities. For a year past he had borne, with
other Cardinals, the new titles of <i>Eminentissime</i> and
<i>Eminence</i>, decreed by Pope Urban VIII., and shared only
by the ecclesiastical Electors of the Empire and the Grand
Master of Malta. He had added to his worldly goods and
to his spiritual power by becoming Coadjutor of the Abbot
of Cluny, and the strength of his resolute will for reform
was felt by the great religious orders as well as by the
secular clergy.</p>

<p>In September 1631 letters patent from the King created
him Duc de Richelieu and a peer of France, and he took his
seat in Parliament with great state, escorted by the Prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
de Condé, the Duc de Montmorency, and a crowd of the
first men in France. From that time he bore the singular
title of “Cardinal-Duc.” He also became governor of
Brittany; and one fortified town after another, throughout
the north of France, fell into his hands and were garrisoned
by friends of his own. He rewarded the Prince de Condé
and the Cardinal de la Valette with the governments of
Burgundy and Anjou.</p>

<p>One foreign Power, at least, was not behindhand in
paying homage to the man whom the King of France
delighted to honour. The Republic of Venice sent him
letters of Venetian nobility, to descend to any one of his
relations he might choose. “And she sent them with
ceremony by an express Gentleman, to whom His Eminence
did not forget to present a very fine chain of gold.”</p>

<p>It seemed that Richelieu had little now to fear from
open enemies at home, though the secret dread of assassination
clung about him with reason to his life’s end. He had
already shown a certain sense of security by acts of indulgence
or of conciliation: the Duc de Vendôme had been
set at liberty and the Duchesse de Chevreuse had been
allowed to return to the Court, while her husband was
made governor of Picardy. Champagne, the important
frontier province, was given as a mark of royal confidence
to the Comte de Soissons.</p>

<p>But there were those, not more guilty, but more dangerous
from their very worth and mental distinction, who
felt the weight of Richelieu’s vengeance. Michel de Marillac,
counted in his own time among “martyrs of the State,”
after languishing for many months in his prison at Châteaudun,
died of grief at the tragic death of his soldier brother.
The trial and death of Marillac “l’Epée” are generally
allowed to be dark stains on the Cardinal’s career. Politically,
there was no case against him, and the Parliament,
when first approached by Richelieu’s tool, the notorious
Laffemas, refused to commit him for trial. Richelieu then
appointed a Royal Commission, which sat at Verdun, the
charge against the Marshal being one of peculation and
oppression when governor there. Even now the Cardinal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
failed to secure a condemnation. The Commissioners
shrank from enforcing the extreme of the law against a
distinguished soldier whose sins were common to his
time and his trade, and the trial dragged on very slowly,
till Richelieu brought matters to a point by summoning the
Commission, strengthened by members of his own choosing
and presided over by the new Chancellor, M. de Châteauneuf,
to meet at his country-house of Rueil. Louis de
Marillac was brought from the fortress of Ste. Menehould,
where he had been imprisoned since his sudden arrest
some fifteen months before. He was condemned to death,
but only by a small majority of his judges. Threatening
letters from the Queen-mother and Monsieur did him no
good, but yet the Cardinal, in his own house and with a
packed jury, could not secure unanimity. All France
agreed with the prisoner’s own cry: “Condemned to die
for hay and straw! Not reason enough to whip a lackey!”</p>

<p>He was beheaded in the Place de Grève on May 2, 1632,
and buried in the Church of the Feuillants, long since
swept away to make room for the Rue Castiglione. There
might be read, for less than two hundred years, the simple
and dignified epitaph in which his heirs handed down to
posterity the high virtues of “this illustrious victim of a
powerful and vindictive Minister.” Madame de Marillac,
who bore the familiar name of Catherine de Médicis, died
of grief within a few months of her husband.</p>

<p>A dozen years later, when Cardinal de Richelieu was
dead, the Parliament of Paris registered a decree acquitting
Louis de Marillac of the crimes for which he ostensibly
suffered.</p>

<p>In that same year 1632 a still nobler head was to fall.
The story of Henry de Montmorency’s ruin tangles itself
with the treasonable adventures of Gaston d’Orléans.</p>

<p>Duke Charles of Lorraine, nominally a vassal of the
Empire, had reasons of his own for giving trouble to
France. For nearly a century she had held part of the old
province of Lorraine, including the “Three Bishoprics,”
Metz, Toul, and Verdun. In giving armed support to the
exiled French prince, Charles IV. had the Empire at his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
back, and a successful invasion of France, with the consequent
fall of Cardinal de Richelieu, was likely not only
to restore his territory but to be a decisive incident in the
Thirty Years’ War. At this moment of happy expectation,
Monsieur fell in love with the young Princess Marguerite
of Lorraine, the Duke’s sister. A year or two before he
had been desperately in love with Princess Marie de
Gonzague, daughter of the Duke of Mantua, and the
Queen-mother had imprisoned her at Vincennes to be out
of his way. This was a more serious affair. A secret,
hurried marriage at Nancy united Gaston to the one
woman who kept her hold on him through the rest of his
frivolous life.</p>

<p>But even before the marriage, the Duke of Lorraine’s
plans of conquest had fallen through. French armies had
crossed his frontier, driving before them the small force
which the Emperor had sent to his aid. From the stronghold
of Metz, Louis XIII. and Cardinal de Richelieu were able
to dictate their own terms. The Duke of Lorraine was
to become a faithful ally of France, and all her enemies
were to be expelled from his territory. In consequence of
this treaty, Monsieur joined his mother at Brussels. Left
to himself, he might have been reconciled with the King,
and Richelieu did his best to that end; but his own friends
and favourites found it to their interest to keep him in
rebellion.</p>

<p>It was not till after the signature of the treaty that
Louis XIII. was made aware of his brother’s marriage,
to which he had definitely refused his consent. In this
and other ways the Duke of Lorraine had played Richelieu
false. The consequence was that a French army once
more swept over the province, seizing towns and fortresses
and bringing Richelieu’s favourite dream—that of extending
the French frontier to the Rhine—perceptibly nearer.</p>

<p>At this moment, having taught the Duke a second severe
lesson, Richelieu held his hand. The victories of Gustavus
Adolphus in Germany were an effectual check on the
house of Hapsburg, and hindered the advance of the
Spanish and Imperial troops on the Rhine. A French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
army was needed at home. Monsieur had left Brussels
with a small army of German, Walloon, and Spanish
mercenaries, and had made a dash through Lorraine, Burgundy,
and Auvergne on his way to Languedoc, with the
encouragement of the Duc de Montmorency. Leaving
Maréchal d’Effiat in command on the German frontier,
Richelieu despatched Schomberg and La Force by different
routes to the south.</p>

<p>Henry de Montmorency, by every title the flower of
the French nobility, was now thirty-seven years old. He
was descended in the direct line, through nineteen generations,
from an ancestor who was baptized with Clovis.
Ever since then the heads of the family had borne the
proud legend of “Premier Chrestien que Roy en France;
premier Seigneur de Montmorency que Roy en France;
premier Baron de France.” Their war-cry was “Dieu
ayde au premier Chrestien”; their motto, “Sans tache.”
Montmorency’s father, his grandfather, and several of his
ancestors had borne the title of Constable of France, and
he was himself High Admiral, till Richelieu purchased the
charge and assumed the duties under another name. He
had succeeded to the government of Languedoc at his
father’s death in 1614, before he was twenty. A popular
governor of a very difficult province constantly torn by
civil war, he spent the greater part of his time in the
south. When not engaged in keeping down his turbulent
Protestants or in managing his provincial Estates, always
discontented, he was to be found in the front rank of
Louis XIII.’s campaigns. He did not care greatly for life
at Court, though, as a boy, he had been a special favourite
with Henry IV., who gave him his name, and though, by
the marriages of his half-sister and sister—one with the
Duc d’Angoulême, the other with the Prince de Condé—he
was nearly connected with the royal family. But he
lived magnificently, when in Paris, at the Hôtel de Montmorency,
and in the country at his châteaux of Écouen or
Chantilly. He was the admiration of society—handsome,
a bold rider, a fine dancer, and a very great flirt, in spite
of the constant love between him and his young Roman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
wife, the best and most devoted of women, Maria Felice
Orsini. Their story is among the most touching romances
of the century.</p>

<p>In many ways the Duc de Montmorency stood above
the ordinary ranks of the noblesse, and a little apart from
them. As proud and sensitive as any, a certain high touch
of generous chivalry kept him free of their vindictive
prejudices—as Cardinal de Richelieu had proved in the
day when Louis XIII. lay ill at Lyons. His loyalty to
the King had always been unimpeachable.</p>

<p>But as early as 1629 the storm which was to sweep
Montmorency into rebellion and ruin had begun to growl
in the south. The governor of Languedoc felt a dangerous
sympathy with his province, one of the old independent
<i>pays d’États</i>, which saw itself deprived of power and
autonomy in the matter of taxation by a centralizing
edict. In the view of the provincial Estates, their “most
sacred rights” were thus invaded and torn away. And
there were not wanting enemies of Richelieu to fan the
flame.</p>

<p>At first it seemed as if the Cardinal would yield to the
remonstrances of Languedoc. During the winter of 1631-2
Montmorency was able to announce to his Estates that
the hated edict would be withdrawn. However, months
dragged on in useless argument with the Cardinal’s commissioners,
who, in Montmorency’s own view, were merely
amusing the Estates while they led them on to a deeper
ruin; while his friends whispered that he himself, as well
as his province, was on the brink of destruction. Some
slight coldness at Court, consequent on a quarrel of his
with the Duc de Chevreuse, was made to signify that
his political opposition to Richelieu, frank and reasonable
as it might be, would bring about sharp and terrible
reprisals.</p>

<p>In this temper the proudest noble and most chivalrous
man in France read a manifesto published by Gaston
d’Orléans in June 1632, in which he summoned the French
to rise on behalf of himself and the exiled Queen-mother,
not against the King, but against the “tyrant” who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
usurped his authority; while at the same time it was
proposed to make Languedoc, already known to be disaffected,
the scene of the new civil war.</p>

<p>There were circumstances which attached Montmorency
to the Queen-mother’s cause. His wife was related to her,
and had always been treated by her with the utmost
kindness. If he had shown a friendliness to Richelieu
which may have justified the Cardinal in being amazed at
the present turn of events, it was yet most natural that
he should feel resentment at the Queen’s forced exile.
Richelieu and many historians following him have thrown
the whole blame of the Duke’s rising on Madame de Montmorency
and her affection for the Queen. Recent researches
have shown this view to be most unfair. Through
the spring and early summer of 1632 the Duchess was
lying ill of fever and knew little of public events. It was
not till the latest moment, too late for any drawing back,
that she heard from her husband of Monsieur’s advance
with his consent to Languedoc. With useless tears she
learned that he, who had fought so loyally for the King,
was now arming against him. When the Prince himself
visited her on his arrival she said to him: “Sir, if M. de
Montmorency could have deferred to the counsel of a
woman, he would never have given you entrance into his
government.”</p>

<p>The fatal step was taken with the full concurrence of
the Estates of Languedoc, in session at Pézénas. D’Elbène,
Bishop of Albi, who has been described as Montmorency’s
evil genius, induced them formally to disregard the royal
edict and to sign a solemn declaration in which they
called on the Duke to make their interests his, as they
would make his theirs, that all might act together for
His Majesty’s service and the good of their country. Thus
“the Estates signed their final abdication; and the Duke
his death-warrant.”</p>

<p>Monsieur’s ride through France, with a group of wild
companions, at the head of two thousand undisciplined
horse, was not likely to do his cause good in the country.
Clamouring constantly for pay and receiving nothing but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
fair words and promises, it was to be expected that
the soldiers should provide for themselves. All along
Monsieur’s route, his biographer tells us, at the earliest
news of his approach, people fled from the villages and
open country into the towns, which one and all shut
their gates. But it was the season of fruit and crops,
“so that the army had not much to suffer.” “Nous
entrâmes dans la Limagne, qu’il faisoit beau voir en cette
saison des fruits, si la licence des gens de guerre ne lui
eût un moment fait changer de face.” And the fate of
the Limagne—the most fertile district of Auvergne—was
a sample of the rest.</p>

<p>Monsieur and his precious army entered Languedoc
in the first week of August, two months before the
Duc de Montmorency was ready for him. The session
of the Estates was only just over; there had been no
time to raise money, to collect troops, or to make sure
of several strong places whose loyalty to the governor
was doubtful. The King had still a powerful party in
Languedoc, and the people generally, with a bitter
experience, dreaded civil war. Meanwhile, with swift
decision, directed from Paris by Richelieu, Marshals de
Schomberg and de la Force were advancing from the
east and the west, hemming in Languedoc and its unlucky
governor.</p>

<p>The armies met at Castelnaudary—spelt by Aubery
Castelnau-d’Arry—and the result of the fight was never
doubtful. Though Monsieur had had some small successes
since entering Languedoc, his friends and officers spoiled
all by quarrels among themselves. Puylaurens, the Duc
d’Elbeuf, and the Comte de Moret, each claimed the
leadership under him, and all refused to give precedence
to the Duc de Montmorency. He was bitterly reproached
for the unreadiness which was no fault of his; and he,
at least, dashed forward in a spirit of reckless despair
to the encounter with the Maréchal de Schomberg and
the Marquis de Brézé, whose army, though small, was
perfectly disciplined, while that of Monsieur fell almost
at once into panic and confusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>Castelnaudary was rather a rout than a battle. Many
of the mercenaries fled without striking a blow, and those
who died fighting were mostly among the unfortunate
“gens de qualité” who had thrown in their lot with
Monsieur. Among these victims the most distinguished
was young Antoine de Bourbon, Comte de Moret, son
of Henry IV. by Jacqueline de Bueil: she long survived
as Comtesse de Vardes, a devout and eccentric lady.
Many persons believed that her son, who had taken
orders and held, with other rich preferments, the Abbey
of St. Étienne at Caen, was carried off alive into Italy
after Castelnaudary, and ended his days, sixty years
later, as a pious hermit in Anjou. The tradition is not
without probability.</p>

<p>No such uncertainty hangs round the fate of Henry
de Montmorency. He fell wounded in a desperate charge
along a hollow lane, made in support of the Comte de
Moret, whose men were in full flight before the enemy.
The lane was commanded by royal musketeers, who
shot down all the Duke’s followers except a few who
dashed forward with him into the ranks of the “cardinalistes.”
“I have sacrificed myself for cowards!” Henry
cried to the officer who took him prisoner—the Comte
de Saint-Preuil, himself one day to be condemned by
Richelieu.</p>

<p>The King and the Cardinal were on their way to
Languedoc when the short campaign thus suddenly ended.
To make peace with Monsieur was their first care, and
this was easily brought about. At first his demands were
haughty and considerable, including a large sum of money,
the return of the Queen-mother, a fortress or two, and
a free pardon for the Duc de Montmorency. All these
conditions were bluntly rejected. Richelieu was not
impressed by the Prince’s solemn promise to love and
esteem him in future.</p>

<p>Gaston’s first thought was to escape to Spain, but the
way was blocked by the royal troops, and a very few
days saw him in abject submission to the King. He even
promised—surely an unnecessary baseness—to take no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
further interest in certain persons who had been united
with him, and to make no complaint should the King
punish them as they deserved. Having thus delivered
up Montmorency and all those who had fought in his
cause and the Queen-mother’s, Gaston rode off for Touraine
with the Duc d’Elbeuf and a few others whom the King
pardoned, while the remnant of his army straggled across
the mountains into Spain.</p>

<p>Then the King and the Cardinal, from their head-quarters
at Béziers, set about arranging the affairs of
Languedoc; and seldom, in his political career, did
Richelieu show a greater wisdom. While tremendous
severity was shown to bishops, barons, all the feudal
magnates who had encouraged or joined in the rebellion—death,
confiscation, tearing down of castles and
fortresses—the provincial Estates were very differently
treated. They were convoked at Béziers, and most of
their just demands were granted by the King. On payment
of a heavy fine they kept to some extent their
ancient liberties.</p>

<p>But a terrible example was made. After Castelnaudary
the wounded governor had been taken to the castle of
Lectoure, and at the end of October, nearly two months
later, he was brought to Toulouse to be tried for his life.
The King and the Cardinal were already there, and all
the prayers of province and kingdom, of high and low,
had for six weeks been prayed in vain. The fact that
M. de Montmorency was one of the very greatest men in
France, that his pardon was humbly begged for not only
by his miserable wife, but by the Princesse de Condé, the
Duc d’Épernon and his sons, the Ducs d’Angoulême,
de Châtillon, de Chevreuse, and many others, only made
his condemnation more sure. Richelieu was bent on
teaching France, once for all, the lesson she had been
slow in learning, that no head was high enough to escape
the vengeance of the King. He listened, not untouched
certainly, but unmoved, even to the crying in the streets—“Grâce,
grâce! Miséricorde!”—with which, night and day,
the people of Toulouse tried to soften the hearts of King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
and Minister. And if we are to believe the biographer
of Père Joseph, any leanings towards mercy in either
were checked by the fiery zeal of the “Eminence grise,”
who pressed upon them both, in secret council of three,
that “to pardon this criminal would encourage all the
rebels in the kingdom, who would not fail to invite
Monsieur to place himself once more at their head,
since they would be sure of impunity ... whereas, a
chief of this rank and quality being put to death, no
one would henceforth dare to declare himself for the
King’s brother.”</p>

<p>The trial, presided over by Richelieu’s Chancellor,
Châteauneuf, was short and decisive: there was no
doubt of the result; but we are told that the judges
wept when they pronounced the sentence, and the
courtiers wept when they heard it. Henry de Montmorency
died that same day, October 30, 1632, on the
scaffold at Toulouse, patiently and bravely, as became the
“premier Chrestien.” In his will, made the day before,
he left a valuable picture, a St. Sebastian, to Cardinal
de Richelieu. The mourning throughout France was such
as had not been seen since the death of King Henry IV.</p>

<p>Terrified by so sharp an object-lesson, Gaston d’Orléans
made one more dash across France and again took refuge
at Brussels. This was a consequence not at all intended
by Cardinal de Richelieu.</p>

<p>Worry and strain, political anxieties constantly fresh,
the knowledge that he was furiously hated by society, that
dozens of desperate men had vowed to kill him, and were
watching for their opportunity—a strong man would have
felt the burden, and Richelieu, whatever the power of his
spirit, was always delicate and frail of body. One of the
worst illnesses of his life came upon him immediately after
the death of the Duc de Montmorency.</p>

<p>The King hurried back to his hunting near Paris, and
it had been arranged that the Cardinal should escort Queen
Anne from Toulouse to Bordeaux, and then to La Rochelle,
after which she was to honour him with a visit at his
hardly finished, magnificent château and new town of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
Richelieu. It was a bad time of year for travelling, and
the Queen and her ladies, one may believe, thought the
whole thing a bore; but the Eminentissime had his reasons
for insisting, and could not be refused.</p>

<p>He was ill when they left Toulouse. At Bordeaux he
became worse, and was forced to take to his bed; a few
days more saw him in apparent extremity. A weight of
bad news fell upon him. The loyal Maréchal de Schomberg
died in Languedoc, where he had succeeded Montmorency
as governor. The death of Gustavus Adolphus
seemed at first a mortal blow to the Protestant cause
and the allies of France in Germany.</p>

<p>The Queen and her Court did not remain at Bordeaux
throughout the Cardinal’s illness, but passed on to make
their tour of the western provinces, his place as their
entertainer being taken by the Commander de la Porte
and the Marquis de la Meilleraye. The position was
curious enough. At any moment news of the Cardinal’s
death might have overtaken them. All France believed
that he was dying; rumours flew through the provinces
that he was already dead. People held their breath an
instant, then forgot prudence and rejoiced, ten years too
soon, as though the report must be true. M. de Châteauneuf
and Madame de Chevreuse behaved with a rashness
that seems amazing, whatever his passion for her and
whatever her hatred of Richelieu. Even before the Queen
left Bordeaux, while the Cardinal’s few devoted friends
were watching by his sick bed, they, with the rest of the
lively Court party, were dancing in public and private
without even any outward show of anxiety, and it was
they, in wild spirits, who made the dark and wintry
journey to La Rochelle a <i>voyage de plaisir</i>. M. de Châteauneuf
already imagined himself First Minister, and Madame
de Chevreuse, ruling the Queen and him, saw France at
her feet.</p>

<p>And then the Cardinal recovered. “From the gates
of the tomb,” says M. Martin, “he rose terrible and struck
down those imprudent persons who had dared to reach
out with a too hasty hand towards his spoils.” The King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
travelled many leagues from Paris to meet him, and
received him in his arms; the courtiers crowded to congratulate
him, weeping for joy! A few weeks later, the
one disgraced and in prison, the other an exile from Court,
M. de Châteauneuf and Madame de Chevreuse had time
to reflect on their own foolishness and the amazing fortunes
of Cardinal de Richelieu.</p>

<p>The Cardinal and his palaces—The château and town of Richelieu—The
Palais-Cardinal—Richelieu’s household, daily life, and friends—The Hôtel
de Rambouillet—Mademoiselle de Gournay—Boisrobert and the first
Academicians—Entertainments at the Palais-Cardinal—<i>Mirame</i>.</p>


<p>The restless, ambitious energy and the passion for
detail which made Cardinal de Richelieu the hardest
worker of his time in politics, were thrown equally
into his characteristic amusements. His love of building
and furnishing splendidly carried him far beyond such
pleasant country-houses as Rueil, Limours, or Bois-le-Vicomte,
luxurious as they were. The Palais-Cardinal
itself, in the heart of Paris and almost royal, had certain
limitations, the architect being blamed for a lack of height
and dignity. Le Mercier excused himself, we are told, by
the Cardinal’s own orders: he desired to give no cause
for jealousy to the great ones of the kingdom who did
not love him “because of the extreme hauteur with which
he treated them, and to show moderation, even in the
disposing of his palace, in the sight of those powerful
persons who were envious of such prodigious credit and
grandeur.”</p>

<p>No scruples interfered in the lonely valley of the Mable,
where for miles around the name of Richelieu now had
no rival. Even Champigny, the once dreaded house of the
Montpensiers, had come into the Cardinal’s possession by
a more or less forced exchange with Gaston d’Orléans, his
little daughter’s untrustworthy guardian. The fine old
château was pulled down; its former outbuildings make
the château of to-day; and the chapel, with its precious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
windows, its tombs and picturesque cloister, was only
saved by the Pope’s refusal to consent to its destruction.
The Cardinal-Duc, though First Minister of France and
head of her army and navy, could not flatly disobey the
Church in a private matter.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">CHÂTEAU DE RICHELIEU</p>

<p class="center small">FROM AN OLD PRINT</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There is more actually left of the old Montpensier
buildings than of the magnificent palace, foreshadowing
the splendour of Versailles, into which Cardinal de
Richelieu transformed the river-fortress of his ancestors.
Wide lawns, stiff alleys and avenues, still moats with
water-lilies, one small pavilion looking sadly over the trees
towards a high gateway where no one seems to enter;
this is all that remains of the far-famed Château de
Richelieu.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1625, soon after he came to power,
that the Cardinal visited Richelieu with Madame de
Combalet, and resolved on the transformation. After this
the work went on for years, and was hardly finished when
he died, though long before that the palace was the
admiration of Europe, only surpassed in France by
Fontainebleau. It was approached by an avenue a mile
and a quarter long, ending in an immense <i>demi-lune</i> on
which the first court opened by a stately gateway with
flanking pavilions. This court led to a second; a bridge
over the moat which, as in old days, surrounded the actual
château, gave admittance to another gateway under a dome,
guarded by a figure of Renown and other mythological
statues. Within this was the <i>cour d’honneur</i>, a square of
great buildings, with high pavilions at the four corners
and in the centre opposite the gateway. Here was the
grand staircase of variegated marble; and here, after the
ruin of the House of Montmorency, stood the famous
Slaves of Michel Angelo, brought from the Duke’s Château
of Écouen. Statues and busts were everywhere.</p>

<p>The further front, beyond another bridge, looked upon
square gardens “embroidered with flowers,” where peacocks
strutted, and through which flowed the imprisoned
Mable in a broad canal full of fish. Beyond this again was
another vast half-moon space of garden and parterre, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
statues, fountains, grottoes, an orangery, and a chapel;
and all was surrounded by the great deer-park and the
woods in ordered beauty, long alleys striking into them,
lost in the shade.</p>

<p>The decoration, in and out, of this wonderful place
shared the Cardinal’s thoughts with the keenest interests
of his political life; and the collection of works of art, for
Richelieu and the Palais-Cardinal, meant in itself a large
correspondence. Besides all this, he had undertaken to
create a town outside the gates of his new palace, its main
street to be of <i>hôtels</i> on one dignified plan, after the model
of the Place Royale, built for themselves by his chief
officers and the nobles whom he meant to attend his Court
at Richelieu. That Court was never held, but the town
rose out of the earth, “as if by enchantment,” with all
kinds of privileges and immunities granted by the King,
and its symmetrical buildings have long survived their
<i>raison d’être</i>, the château. There is indeed more life now
in that seventeenth-century street than when La Fontaine
wrote of its admired but monotonous rows of houses:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Cardinal’s devoted friend, the Archbishop of
Bordeaux, acted as surveyor of the works at Richelieu,
and in a letter to him in June 1632, between the execution
of Marillac and Monsieur’s invasion of Languedoc, we have
evidence of the way in which every exterior and interior
detail was thought out by an unresting brain. The
painting of the rooms was now in full swing, being mostly
designed by Simon Vouet, the King’s favourite painter, and
carried out by him and other artists.</p>

<p>After giving orders as to the decoration of a large room
above the entrance, the Cardinal proceeds:</p>

<p>“The vaulted cabinet at the side should be painted in
<i>grisaille</i> on the stone vaulting, partly by the painter from
Lyons, and partly by other painters, who will enrich the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
<i>grisaille</i> with gold. M. de Bordeaux, being on the spot,
will make them agree together as to what each shall do.
In this cabinet there must be a wainscot six feet high
with a recess to hold rarities, and the said wainscot shall
be painted in <i>grisaille</i> of one tint and gilded to match the
vaulting. M. Vouet can very well design the paintings.”</p>

<p>Architectural details regarding the level of different
rooms, their respective heights, their flat or vaulted ceilings,
fill a good part of the letter. Everywhere there are six-foot
wainscotings with shelves or recesses for “rarities”;
for His Eminence’s collection of <i>objets d’art</i> was already
famous in Europe.</p>

<p>Then he goes on to the gardens.</p>

<p>“My uncle tells me that the canal at Richelieu is full
of weeds. At the end of the summer, when the lawns are
levelled and the masons are no longer working on the
banks of the said canal, it must be entirely drained and all
the weeds must be rooted up and burnt in its bed; and
when it is clean and dry let it be filled again, and put a boat
on it, and make a bargain with a strong and vigorous man
who has nothing else to do, that he will not suffer a weed in
it but will tear them up as they grow, which may be done
with tools of iron made for the purpose. In that country it
suffices a man if he have enough to live on, so that I think
a hundred francs or forty crowns will acquit me.”</p>

<p>With quite as eager an interest, both now and again
later, even when Monsieur is “drawing towards Languedoc”
and political storms are darkening all the horizon, he writes
of pictures from Mantua that he is sending to Richelieu, of
the preservation, with new floors and beams, of his father’s
old rooms—a fancy which, in Mademoiselle de Montpensier’s
opinion, spoiled the grandeur of the house—of building a
park wall; and last, not least, of the new town and the
houses that his friends are building there. A little hurry,
he thinks, would not be out of place, for he is bent on
making Richelieu, his own town, a centre of trade, of justice,
of enlightenment, to all the western country.</p>

<p>Though almost incredible, it appears to be a fact that
the Cardinal died in 1642 without ever having visited his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
new palace and little city of Richelieu. Various royal and
distinguished guests, however, were entertained there in
his lifetime by his niece or other representatives.</p>

<p>But Paris knew the Cardinal intimately well. His last
eight years of life and work were chiefly spent at the
Palais-Cardinal. From its completion, in the winter of
1633-4, he lived there in almost royal splendour. Though
the exterior may have suffered from jealousy in high places,
the apartments were far more gorgeous, more heavily
luxurious, than those at Richelieu—which must have
possessed, from descriptions, a kind of cool beauty and
delicate grace suited to the tender lines and colouring of
Poitou. At the Palais-Cardinal, the windows were glazed
with “large squares of crystal mounted in silver.” Rooms,
halls, staircases, galleries, cabinets, were a blaze of colour;
there were ceilings all gold, with allegorical pictures in
mosaic, to the Cardinal’s glory. The walls were hung
with pictures by the greatest artists, French and Italian;
there was a gallery of famous men, some of the portraits
painted by Philippe de Champagne, others by Simon Vouet.
The furniture throughout was magnificent, and the art
treasures of every kind represented the work of collectors
all over Europe. The gardens, in those early days, were
charming in their formal beauty; lawns and clipped box
hedges, a mosaic of flowers, long alleys of trees, and a high
terrace with a famous iron-work balustrade which was
destroyed in 1786 by the bad taste of the Duc de Chartres,
then possessor of the palace.</p>

<p>The Cardinal’s household was large, and devoted to him;
whatever his character at Court and abroad, at home he
was neither an ogre nor a sphinx, but a hard-working,
autocratic, fiery, not ungenerous gentleman. His chaplains
and almoners could bear witness to his widespread charity,
ranging from the sick and poor in the streets of Paris to
peasants ruined by war, and from colleges and hospitals to
small forgotten convents which found themselves supplied,
by his orders, with bread and meat they had no money
to buy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>The Cardinal’s household included at least five-and-twenty
pages of noble birth, who received the same training
in arms, horsemanship, mathematics, and dancing as if they
had belonged to Royalty. A number of “gentlemen of
condition” waited on him constantly and dined at his second
table; the first was reserved for himself—when well enough
to be there—and for his intimate friends, relations, and
special guests. He had five hard-worked private secretaries,
clerical and lay: the Prieur des Roches, Charpentier, Chéré,
Mulot, Rossignol; his private physician, M. Citoys, often
served him in the same way. Among his State secretaries
and special agents, who directed, as we know, an army of
spies at home and abroad, Père Joseph and his Capuchin
clerks held the first place. “Ezéchiéli,” as the Cardinal
called him, had his offices in the palace, and visited His
Eminence by day and by night.</p>

<p>The Bouthilliers, father and son, with M. de Noyers,
were among his most confidential counsellors and fellow-workers;
and in more private fashion Laffemas, head of
the Paris police and known as “le bourreau du Cardinal,”
brought him the evil report of his enemies. In later years
Mazarin became his trusted diplomatic agent and chosen
successor. The Cardinal de la Valette, the Archbishop of
Bordeaux, the Marquis de Brézé, the Marquis de la Meilleraye—these
two being created by him Marshals of France—may
be described as his aides-de-camp; and beyond all
these buzzed a crowd of political pamphleteers and other
writers in the Cardinal’s pay; conspicuous among them
Renaudot—founder under him of the <i>Gazette de France</i>, the
first approach to a modern newspaper—Corneille the poet,
and various members of the young Academy.</p>

<p>The Cardinal was fond of music, and his band of twelve
instruments attended him everywhere. But what really
made his train “august and majestic,” says Aubery, was
the strong force of guards always present for his defence.
The King had added two hundred musketeers and a
company of gendarmes to the hundred horse originally
granted him, and these troops were quartered in and
around his palace, being on duty by turns, as if attending
on Royalty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>The officers of the guard were not always lucky enough
to please His Eminence. This is a characteristic story:</p>

<p>“He had said one day to Saint-Georges, his captain of
the guard, that he wished to walk after dinner in his gallery
at the Palais-Cardinal and would see no one there; nevertheless,
entering with M. de Noyers, he found two Capuchins.
After giving them a favourable audience, and finishing
his business with M. de Noyers, he scolded his captain
of the guard for disobeying his orders, and treated him to
hard words, telling him plainly that he would be obeyed,
and that if he ever committed such a fault again, he would
not come off so cheaply.</p>

<p>“The gentleman, furious at such disgrace, and believing
that he could not remain in the service with honour, took
leave to retire, without farewell, to some inn in the Rue
St. Honoré. So that M. le Cardinal, seeing him no more,
asked for news of him; and learning what had happened,
begged the Commander de la Porte to go and find him and
bring him back. But the Commander failing to do so,
His Eminence charged M. de la Meilleraye to go in his
turn, and to bring him back by any means in his power.
Which at last he did, after trouble enough in persuading
him. So that His Eminence, seeing him enter the room,
went five or six steps to meet him, and embracing him with
much kindness, said: ‘Saint-Georges, we were both very
hasty; but if you are like me, you will never think of it
again. God forbid that my hastiness should ruin the fortunes
of a gentleman such as you: on the contrary, I will
do you all the good I can.’”</p>

<p>After which one does not wonder that the Cardinal’s
own people liked him.</p>

<p>His constant ill-health, with the weight of State affairs,
made a regular life necessary to him. He went to bed at
eleven, but after three or four hours of restless sleep he was
generally to be found sitting up in his room, his worn face
bent over portfolio or writing-table, his thin hand and
active brain guiding the politics of Europe. Thus he
would work from candlelight to dawn, writing and dictating,
till fatigue obliged him to lie down and sleep again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
But he was up before eight and working with his secretaries;
then, when dressed, he received the King’s other Ministers;
then heard mass, which he celebrated himself on great
festivals; and then, before the mid-day dinner, gave
audience in the garden to any one who wished to see him.
After dinner he talked with his friends and guests till it
was necessary to visit the King, to receive ambassadors and
great men, to attend in public to important affairs of State.
It was not till evening that he allowed himself any real
quiet and recreation. Then we may see him strolling again
in the garden, playing with his favourite cats, listening to
music, laughing with the few familiars, such as the lively
Abbé de Boisrobert, whose privilege it was to amuse him;
and so, with private prayers that lasted half an hour, ended
his days at the Palais-Cardinal.</p>

<p>He was always, of course, unpopular at Court and in
society; not only because he was feared and mistrusted,
but owing to an air of pedantry and affectation which was
unpleasing to everybody and especially so to women; yet
he particularly liked to make himself agreeable to them.
When all the fables of his love-affairs are cleared away,
this characteristic trait remains. He despised women, but
he was ready to bid pretty high, sometimes, for their
confidence and admiration. Several times, for instance,
Madame de Chevreuse escaped with the punishment of
temporary exile for plots and treasons which would have
cost a man his head. The Cardinal would have been glad
to stand high in her favour, as well as in that of her royal
mistress. As their hatred grew with years, so did his hardness
and severity, till the Duchess, leaving Queen Anne in
danger and disgrace, fled finally to Spain.</p>

<p>His niece, with whom he was on the most intimate,
affectionate terms, seems to have been the only woman
who really cared for Cardinal de Richelieu. For her he
planned various great marriages in France and Lorraine,
all of which came to nothing. He gave her the Petit-Luxembourg
when he moved to his new palace, but she
still overlooked his housekeeping and was the leading
figure in his entertainments. Society realized her power,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
and treated her with considerable reverence, though it
laughed behind her back and told many malicious stories.
As a fact, Madame de Combalet—created Duchesse d’Aiguillon
in 1638—filled a difficult position well; strengthening
it by friendships with distinguished women such as
the Princesse de Condé and Mademoiselle d’Angennes, the
famous Julie of the poets, the star of her mother’s salon at
the Hôtel de Rambouillet.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Rambouillet has been already mentioned
as a steady friend of Cardinal de Richelieu, and though
His Eminence was not to be seen at Madame de Rambouillet’s
assemblies—the centre of civilising influence long
before his noonday of power—he took a keen and partly
sympathetic interest in all that went on there. His brilliant
intelligence could not fail to recognise the great work done
for society by “the divine Arthénice” in her blue drawing-room,
where savage manners were softened and refined,
military roughness was smoothed, coarse gossip discouraged;
some touch of culture and literary taste being made
a passport to the hostess’s favour. It seems certain that
political intrigue found no place at the Hôtel de Rambouillet;
but it is characteristic of Richelieu’s nervous, suspicious
mind that he was not convinced of this. The long
flirtation carried on by his friend the Cardinal de la Valette
with the Princesse de Condé, both of them constant guests
there, caused him some anxiety, and the story goes that he
sent Père Joseph to Madame de Rambouillet with promises
of advancement for her husband if she would keep him
informed of the “intrigues” of these two. The Marquise
replied: “I do not believe, Father, that Madame la
Princesse and M. le Cardinal de la Valette have any
intrigues; but if they have, I should not be the person
to act as a spy!” It seems that Cardinal de la Valette,
who was clever and witty, did indulge in the dangerous
pleasure of laughing at Richelieu’s pedantries, and with
Madame de Rambouillet herself, “in whom he had entire
confidence,” and who enjoyed the joke.</p>

<p>Richelieu’s keenness of intellect and political intuition
were not matched by the delicate wit and lightness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
touch that are usually a Frenchman’s birthright. He was
rather fond of making jokes, but they were often heavy,
if not grim, and better calculated to amuse himself than
his hearers. Mademoiselle de Gournay had experience of
this. She was a clever literary woman in a time when
such women were rare. Montaigne adopted her as a
daughter, and by his wish she published an edition of his
works after his death, with a preface of her own. This
was in 1595. At the height of Richelieu’s fame she was
an old and eccentric woman, living in Paris, known as
the author of <i>L’Ombre</i>, a poetical work full of ancient
and far-fetched words and high-flown sentiments. The
fashionable young poets and literary men of Paris found
pleasure in teasing and ridiculing Mademoiselle de
Gournay.</p>

<p>In 1635 she edited a new edition of Montaigne, which
she dedicated to Cardinal de Richelieu. She was invited
to an audience at the Palais-Cardinal. Richelieu paid her
the necessary compliments, but in obsolete words which
he had carefully chosen out of <i>L’Ombre</i>. He was highly
pleased with himself, and his attendants were choking with
laughter. But Mademoiselle de Gournay was an aristocrat.
Not for nothing was she <i>bien demoiselle</i>, as Tallemant
says. “Elle avoit vu le beau monde.”</p>

<p>“‘You are laughing at the poor old woman,’ she said.
‘Laugh, great genius, laugh: it is right that every one
should contribute to your diversion.’”</p>

<p>The Eminentissime was ashamed of himself, and asked
her pardon. Afterwards he pensioned her handsomely,
and not only her, but her old servant Mademoiselle Jamyn
and her favourite cat Piaillon, not forgetting Piaillon’s
kittens. The Abbé de Boisrobert, Mademoiselle de
Gournay’s good friend, brought these claims irresistibly
before a lover of cats.</p>

<p>At the height of favour as jester, verse-maker and
confidential gossip, Boisrobert was a fount of honours
and pensions at the Palais-Cardinal. Poor poets and other
literary men were the special objects of his care. He was
a clever busybody who went everywhere and knew every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
one of the scribblers in verse and prose, social, political,
theological, classical, dramatic, or of more trifling kind,
who had drifted up mostly from the provinces into
Parisian garrets and hung about the hôtels of the great,
depending on patronage for their daily bread. It was
among these scattered units of varied birth and talent,
all belonging to “the republic of letters,” that the French
Academy began to exist, and Boisrobert has the right to
be called one of its founders.</p>

<p>His character of favourite and of universal patron, as
well as his literary skill, admitted him to weekly meetings
of a few chosen spirits in the Marais, at the house of
Valentin Conrart, <i>bourgeois</i>, Protestant, and man of letters.
Boisrobert’s position at the Palais-Cardinal made it natural
that he should carry the report of these meetings direct
to Richelieu. The Minister was not altogether pleased.
He disliked private assemblies; too often, in his experience,
they meant conspiracy, and he would gladly have
made them illegal.</p>

<p>The arguments of Boisrobert, if they did not quite
reassure the Cardinal, suggested to him a means of utilising
these literary meetings to the advantage of the State
and of the French language. He proposed to Conrart and
his friends, through Boisrobert, that they should become
a public body with letters-patent, bound by its own
statutes and holding its assemblies under royal authority,
with the object of purifying and regularising the language
and literature of France. The men of letters struggled a
little, for liberty was sweet. But they soon submitted,
and the Forty Immortals took their place among those
French institutions which have survived the old world in
which they were born.</p>

<p>As long as Richelieu lived the Academy worked under
his presiding authority. He encouraged no frivolity, no
discussion of trifles, but insisted on hard, steady work.
The great Dictionary, first planned by the poet Chapelain,
was seriously begun in 1634 and carried on by the most
methodical among the new academicians, some of whom
were considerably laughed at by the free literary world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
outside. They were, in fact, slaves to a Minister who,
besides having an unfounded faith in his own taste, was
a critic swayed by reasons extra-literary: one need hardly
mention that the Academy, under Richelieu, snubbed
Corneille and condemned <i>Le Cid</i>, too Spanish and too
independent to please His Eminence.</p>

<p>The slavery was profitable: places and pensions made
life liveable for the wiser academicians of Richelieu’s
day—whose survivors were described by La Bruyère as
“vieux corbeaux,” croaking as their master had taught
them. And they grew to love their chains, while pouring
flattery at the great man’s feet. Guillaume Colletet, more
drunkard than poet, composed a <i>rondeau</i> which was
presented by Boisrobert to the Cardinal:</p>

    <div class="verse indent18">Au grand Armand!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is to the honour of Pierre Corneille that he did not,
till many years later, find a place among these “roys des
esprits.” The Cardinal had been disappointed in him.
Before the Academy existed he was one of five poetical
secretaries who were employed by His Eminence to
arrange his own original ideas in poetry and drama. The
other four were Boisrobert, l’Estoile, Colletet, and Rotrou.
It seems that Corneille was too honest for his place; his
criticism too frank and his opinion too positive. He was
soon dismissed, the Cardinal finding that he lacked “esprit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
de suite”; which may be translated as the gift of following
blindly wherever his patron chose to lead.</p>

<p>Richelieu had a passion for plays and ballets, and
employed a troup of actors of his own. They were the
third company in Paris, the others belonging to the Théâtre
des Marais and the Hôtel de Bourgogne. There were
two theatres at the Palais-Cardinal, and the smaller was
generally used for the comedies, dances, and other entertainments
constantly attended by their Majesties and the
Court. Here were performed pieces arranged by the
Cardinal’s own authors: <i>Les Tuileries</i> and <i>L’Aveugle de
Smyrne</i>, dull comedies magnificently staged; livelier pieces
such as <i>Clorise</i>, by Baro, a very popular play-writer; other
fashionable plays; ballets in which young Royalties danced—Mademoiselle,
Gaston’s daughter, Mademoiselle de Bourbon,
Mademoiselle de Longueville, Mademoiselle de Vendôme,
the Duc d’Enghien; his future wife Mademoiselle
de Maillé-Brézé, and other nieces and cousins of the
Cardinal. These gay fantastic ballets, even more than
regular plays, were the delight of society, young and
old. All the courtiers and great ladies joined in them;
Louis XIII. himself often composed both the words
and the music of lutes, spinets, violins, and forgot his
gloomy stiffness in dancing.</p>

<p>In the intervals of the performances the Cardinal’s
guests enjoyed rare fruits and dainty sweetmeats, handed
round by his pages in baskets tied with English ribbons
of gold and silver tissue. When comedy and dance were
over the company was offered a gorgeous supper on the
great service of plate which the Cardinal left to the King.</p>

<p>The entertainments at the Palais-Cardinal reached their
zenith in January 1641, with the representation of <i>Mirame</i>.
Richelieu, to quote a contemporary, “témoigna des tendresses
de père pour cette pièce”; and it seems actually
to have been in great part his work, in collaboration with
the academician Desmarets. The larger of his two
theatres, holding three thousand persons, was used for
the first time and decorated with special magnificence. It
was rather a vast saloon than a theatre, with gilded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
galleries for the most distinguished guests; the ordinary
admiring crowd finding place on the floor. His Eminence,
happy and triumphant, was near the Queen: the Abbé de
Marolles, once a timid student, now a critical spectator,
describes him as dressed in a long mantle of flame-coloured
taffeta over a black soutane, with collar and facings of
ermine.</p>

<p>The scenery of the play, with the new machinery
which astonished all eyes, had been ordered from Italy
by Cardinal Mazarin, now a familiar figure in Paris and
Richelieu’s right hand. There was a long perspective of
palaces and gardens, with terraces, grottos, fountains,
statues, all looking out over the sea, “with agitations,”
says the <i>Gazette</i>, “which seemed natural to the waves of
that vast element, and two large fleets, one appearing two
leagues distant, both of which passed in sight of the
spectators.”</p>

<p>Over this lovely scene night gradually fell, and all was
lit up by the moon. Then, just as naturally, day dawned
and the sun rose, taking his turn in this “agréable
tromperie.”</p>

<p>The majority of the guests were amazed and transported
beyond measure. A few critics, among whom was the
Abbé de Marolles, did not particularly care for all this
“fine machinery and grand perspective.” He found it
fatiguing to the eyes and the mind: in his opinion a
comedy should depend for success on story, poetry, and
fine acting. “Le reste n’est qu’un embarras inutile.”</p>

<p>There were other more malicious critics who saw in the
story of the play—the love of Princess Mirame, daughter
of the King of Bithynia, for the daring sailor Arimant,
commanding the fleet of Colchos, with all the tragical
events which at last brought about a happy ending—a
veiled allusion to the old romance of Queen Anne and the
Duke of Buckingham. It is very improbable, to say the
least, that Richelieu, who had at this time ceased to persecute
the Queen, should choose to offend her afresh by
stirring up grievances fifteen years old. His object, never
indeed attained, was to live at peace among princes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
nobles who had learnt their lesson. What really annoyed
him in connection with this performance of <i>Mirame</i> was
the discovery by his watchful enemies of various disreputable
persons among the invited guests. The King
was displeased; Monsieur enjoyed the incident; and the
Cardinal could only revenge himself on an unlucky official
who had been too free with his cards of admittance.</p>

<p>In spite of fault-finders <i>Mirame</i> was a triumph. Standing
up in his place, the Cardinal joyfully acknowledged
the constant thunders of applause, then waving his hand
for silence, that none of his fine lines might be missed.
When the play was over, and the Queen had passed on a
golden bridge drawn by peacocks to a silver throne prepared
for her beyond the lifted curtain of the stage, to
preside over a grand ball that ended the evening, there
was no prouder man in Europe than her host—the weary,
sickly statesman who had already given provinces to
France and made her paramount in Italy and Spain.</p>

</div>

<p>From the year 1630, Richelieu had employed historians
and antiquaries in hunting up documents to justify
his plans for the greater glory of France. Amazing
were the pretensions that these learned persons encouraged
him to make for his King. According to them, Louis XIII.
might claim sovereign rights over England, Spain, Milan,
Naples, and Sicily, not to mention Flanders, Artois,
Franche-Comté, Lorraine, and other frontier provinces.
How far Richelieu’s dreams of conquest really extended,
it is difficult to say. But the year 1633 found him resolved
at least, in his own words, to “re-establish the monarchy
in its original greatness” by asserting “the ancient rights
of the Crown”; and Duke Charles of Lorraine soon gave
him his desired opportunity of annexing a large part of
the old Austrasian province.</p>

<p>Relying on imperial support and on his sister’s
marriage with the heir-presumptive of France, the Duke
had broken treaties and had neglected to pay homage
for his French fief, the duchy of Bar. In the summer
of 1633 the Parliament of Paris was directed by Richelieu
to declare that duchy confiscated to France. In August
a French army, led by the King and the Cardinal, marched
once more upon the frontier of Lorraine.</p>

<p>The Duke tried to gain time, hoping for the help of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
a Spanish army under the Duke of Feria, which was
advancing from Italy. He sent his brother, Cardinal
Nicolas-François, to negotiate with the French, offering
not only to consent to the dissolution of his sister’s
marriage, but that the Cardinal, who had taken only
minor orders, should ally himself with Richelieu by
marrying Madame de Combalet. This proposal was
coolly put aside by Richelieu, who observed that he
had not advised the King to enter Lorraine with a
powerful army for his private family ends. He insisted
that Nancy, the capital, with Princess Marguerite in
person, should be placed in the King’s hands as a pledge
of submission.</p>

<p>As to his sister, Duke Charles was willing enough,
being painfully aware that the alliance with Gaston was
a mistake which might ruin him; but he would not consent
to surrender his capital, protesting, with oaths, that he
would rather burn it down. Nevertheless, the city did
not stand a long siege; but when Louis XIII. and Richelieu
made their entry, their promised captive had escaped.
By the help of her brother the Cardinal, and with great
spirit and courage on her own part, Madame Marguerite
had slipped out of Nancy at the beginning of the blockade,
and in a page’s disguise had joined her husband at
Brussels. There she was formally received as Duchess
of Orléans by the Queen-mother and the Infanta, and
the marriage was confirmed by the Archbishop of Malines.</p>

<p>Richelieu was not altogether displeased. Well convinced
of his power to separate Monsieur from his new wife
as soon as the Prince himself should return to France and
his duty, he was not sorry to have an honourable excuse for
going to extremes with the Duke of Lorraine. No hostage,
no capital. Duke Charles was helpless; his sister was no
longer in his hands; his Spanish allies, checked on their
way by a Protestant army, failed to come to his aid. He
had to see a parliament established in Metz and almost
the whole of his province garrisoned by French troops.
When the King returned to Paris the lilies of France were
flying over Lorraine. Town after town submitted, fortress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
after fortress. In January 1634 Charles abdicated for the
time in favour of his brother the Cardinal, and with the
small remains of his army took service under the Emperor.</p>

<p>Then Cardinal de Richelieu bent all his energies to
forcing on Gaston’s return to France and reconciliation
with his brother. He regarded this as a necessity of
State, and he was equally resolved that the Queen-mother,
who had made some overtures on her own account, should
never again set foot in France. Both Marie and Gaston,
while quarrelling between themselves, played the Minister’s
game by their own foolishness. A murderer, caught at
Metz, was suspected with reason of being sent from
Brussels by Chanteloube, Marie’s unwise counsellor,
to attempt the life of Richelieu: he lost his own. The
same fate befell others, in Lorraine and elsewhere, charged
with the same designs; and while this secret campaign
went on, Gaston and his favourite Puylaurens made an
independent treaty with Spain, promising to invade France
with a foreign army to be supplied by the Imperial generals
in the Low Countries.</p>

<p>Well served by spies, Richelieu knew all this. He
replied to Monsieur’s treason by representing to the
King that such a prince, who could promise French
fortresses to the enemy, was not fit to wear the crown;
and with a bold decision before which, at such a crisis,
not even the hereditary monarchy was sacred, he proposed
a league of nobles and princes of the blood who should
pledge themselves, in case of Louis’ death, against the
unconditional succession of his brother. France after all,
in the eyes of Richelieu, was greater than her kings.</p>

<p>By the autumn of 1634 Puylaurens and his master
knew that they had made a huge mistake in allying
themselves with Spain. No troops were forthcoming,
and it began to be evident that the prospect was not
one of triumph and revenge, but of ruin and perpetual
exile. All through September M. de Puylaurens was
negotiating secretly with Cardinal de Richelieu, promising
for Monsieur, among other things, the renunciation of his
marriage, and also making a good bargain for himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>Gaston left Brussels one day in October, and galloped
hard to the frontier. He had been an exile for two years,
and was enchanted to see France again. His little daughter,
Mademoiselle, now seven years old, met him at Limours,
and flew joyfully into the arms of a gay and fascinating
father.</p>

<p>As to Madame, left behind in Flanders, her marriage
was solemnly declared null and void by an assembly of
French clergy, as having been contracted against the civil
law. In this decision, however, the clergy acted on Gallican
lines, independently of the Pope, who was of a different
opinion; and although, after long resistance, Monsieur
formally submitted, he had protected himself in advance by
a letter to Urban VIII. refusing to be bound by any extorted
promise. The consequence was, that Richelieu’s apparent
triumph in this affair of the Lorraine marriage only lasted
his life. Gaston and Marguerite remained faithful to each
other; and the stiff Madame who reigned in after years at
Blois and at the Luxembourg was the same Princess, the
heroine, in her adventurous girlhood, of a secret marriage
and a romantic escape.</p>

<p>It was that private letter of Gaston’s to the Pope which
brought about the ruin of the unlucky Puylaurens. He
had gained high favour with Richelieu, who had purchased
his faithful service, as he thought, by making him a duke
and a peer of France and by marrying him to his own first
cousin, Mademoiselle Philippe de Pontchâteau, younger
daughter of his aunt, Louise du Plessis, his father’s sister.
The marriage took place in Paris at the end of November
1634, and on the same day the Duc de la Valette, son of
the Duc d’Épernon and widower of Henry IV.’s daughter,
Mademoiselle de Verneuil, was married to the elder sister,
Marie de Pontchâteau, and the Comte, afterwards Maréchal,
de Guiche to another cousin, Mademoiselle du Plessis de
Chivray. The Cardinal celebrated the triple wedding by
a magnificent fête. At this time the first nobles in France
found it politic to quarrel for the honour of his alliance, and
it was matter of general talk in society that he meant to
marry Monsieur to Madame de Combalet, the Lorraine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
marriage being set aside. This report even reached the
ears of Monsieur’s little daughter, and filled her with just
indignation.</p>

<p>A few weeks after the wedding the Cardinal’s spies
brought him not only the secret, well kept by Puylaurens,
of Monsieur’s letter to Rome, but proofs of a fresh treasonable
correspondence carried on by the new Duke with
Spain. Swiftly fell Richelieu’s vengeance. Puylaurens,
with several of his friends, was arrested at the Louvre on
February 14, and carried off by royal order to Vincennes.
The entreaties of Monsieur, newly reconciled at Court,
delayed his trial, but he died after four months of prison.
“His good fortune,” says Richelieu, “withdrew him from
this world, and saved him from the infamy of a shameful
death, which he could not have escaped.”</p>

<p>Whether the fatal atmosphere of the dungeons of
Vincennes was assisted by poison of a more active kind,
will never be known. That suspicion hung about the deaths
of many of the Cardinal’s prisoners. Richelieu consoled
the young widow of Puylaurens by marrying her to the
Comte d’Harcourt, of the House of Lorraine, younger
brother of the Duc d’Elbeuf, a queer personage, but a fine
soldier. He had fought a successful duel with Bouteville,
in itself a distinction. He proved himself worthy of the
Cardinal’s favour by serving His Eminence faithfully for
the rest of his life.</p>

<p>But for Richelieu, the Thirty Years’ War might have
ended with the death of Wallenstein and the imperial
victories which followed it. Even the Protestant princes
of Germany were ready for a compromise with the Emperor.
But Richelieu had no intention of accepting a general peace
which would leave his Swedish friends weak and dissatisfied,
his own conquests incomplete, Spain and Austria easily
predominant in Italy and the Low Countries. He resolved
that France, as an ally of Sweden, Holland, and the German
Protestants, should now take an active part in the war,
and he prepared for the actual declaration by a treaty
with the Dutch for the partition of the Spanish Netherlands,
to be followed by one with the Dukes of Savoy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
Parma, and Mantua, for the conquest and division of the
Milanese.</p>

<p>In May 1635, after some military provocation on the
part of Spain, Louis XIII. sent his herald-at-arms to
Brussels—a noble Gascon, Jean Gratiollet, Captain of
Abbeville—and solemnly declared war against his brother-in-law,
Philip IV., while publicly inviting the Low Countries
to rebel against Spain. “Europe was amazed,” says a
modern French writer, “to see Richelieu suddenly take up
arms for those same Huguenots whom he had crushed with
such good will at La Rochelle.”</p>

<p>Europe was amazed: and what of the French nation,
flung unconsulted into the struggle with Catholic Europe
which might easily have become a fight for its own existence?
The three Estates of the realm had each its own
separate point of view. The princes and nobles loved war;
but the majority, Catholic and hating Richelieu, were rebels
at heart. However, each man had his orders: content or
malcontent, each governor found himself dispatched to his
own province, each commander to his post, while generals
dashed hither and thither in pursuit of armies which had
to be hired, recruited, disciplined, poured in half-a-dozen
directions over the frontier—Germany, Flanders, Lorraine,
Switzerland, Italy. Richelieu, the directing brain, at this
moment of high energy, moved the members even against
their will.</p>

<p>To most of the clergy, again, the war was of the nature
of sacrilege; and still more so, later on, the demand of an
enormous payment of arrears for lands held under the
Crown, which had been suffered to go free for nearly a
hundred years. But at a time when the taxes of France
had rolled up to more than a hundred million francs a year,
a gigantic and as yet unheard-of sum, Richelieu could no
longer grant the clergy the privilege of paying no tax but
their prayers, which he had himself claimed for them at the
States-General of 1613.</p>

<p>“The people give their goods, the nobles their blood,
the clergy their prayers.” As ever, the patience of the most
heavily taxed seemed almost inexhaustible; and it was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
till France was deeply engaged in the war, her middle class
and her peasantry crushed by Richelieu’s intendants and
financiers under burdens every week more enormous, that
in the south and the north populations made some effort
to save themselves; made it by rioting, their only resource,
and found themselves—<i>Croquants</i> in Guienne, <i>Va-nu-pieds</i>
in Normandy—in a last state worse than the first.</p>

<p>In spite of all these discontents there were ways in
which Frenchmen now realized the national unity which
was Richelieu’s dream. The famous leader, Duke Henry
de Rohan, was again in arms, not now as a Huguenot
chief, but commanding an army against the Duke of
Lorraine, fighting for his duchy with imperial troops
behind him. In the spring of 1635, it was to Rohan that
Richelieu committed the task of preparing for his designs
on Milan by a new occupation of the Valtelline, thus once
more playing the old game of blocking the chief military
road between Austria and Spain. All went well at first,
the Duke proving himself a loyal subject and a good
general. The cause that finally discomfited him and drove
him at last to throw up his command and to retire to
Geneva was the failure of Richelieu’s government to pay a
promised indemnity to the Grisons, rightful possessors of
the valley, who after two years’ French occupation, secretly
encouraged by Spain, rebelled suddenly against Rohan and
insisted on the evacuation of their territory. Blamed by
Richelieu for a failure which was no fault of his, and
broken by severe illness, the Huguenot hero was still
ready to bear arms for France. In the spring of 1638 he
volunteered to serve under Duke Bernard of Saxe-Weimar—the
great soldier who, if actually fighting for his own
hand, nevertheless gave Alsace to France—and died of his
wounds after the siege of Rheinfeld, having lived long
enough to know with what swift brilliance Bernard had
turned defeat into victory.</p>

<p>For many months, as readers of history know, the
fortune of war went against Richelieu. The ravages of
the French and the Dutch armies in the Netherlands, under
the Prince of Orange and the Marshals de Châtillon and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
de Brézé, did not incline the population to change masters.
In Germany, one town after another fell into imperialist
hands, and it was only with difficulty that the French held
their own in Lorraine. The invasion of the Milanese
failed; and later on the deaths of the Dukes of Savoy
and of Mantua deprived France of two important allies.</p>

<p>The French fleet, though making a fine show for
those days—forty-seven men-of-war—wasted its strength
in vainly flourishing about the coast; and owing to the
quarrels of its commanders, the Comte d’Harcourt and
the Archbishop of Bordeaux, with M. de Vitry, governor
of Provence—the slayer of Concini—did not for a long
time succeed in even recovering the Isles of Lérins, seized
by Spain at the opening of the war.</p>

<p>And then, in July 1636, a terrible disaster threatened
France. Imperial troops crossed the frontier, and had taken
two strong places in Picardy, La Capelle and Le Catelet,
before the French commanders were ready to oppose them.
Imperial cavalry crossed the Somme and advanced to the
Oise, the Comte de Soissons retreating before them, and
spread a very natural terror throughout the country.
They were mostly Croats and Hungarians, fierce and
savage men, whose road was marked by robbery, fire, and
slaughter. Their leader was the Bavarian, John of Werth,
a name of fear in the campaigns of his day.</p>

<p>Paris was in a state of terror and fury. The black
shadows of the streets, in the sweltering heat of late July
and early August, were loud with raging men and women,
whose voices taught the Cardinal-Duc his unpopularity.
Paris was ill fortified, ill defended, and part of her strong
old walls had been destroyed by him for the sake of his
Palais-Cardinal. They cried against him because of that;
because of his ingratitude to the Queen-mother, his failure,
so far, in the war he had undertaken, his alliance with
heretics. And Richelieu knew that their fear, if not their
hatred, was too well justified. The Comte de Soissons,
whose army, camping in the forests and holding the fords
of the Oise, protected Paris, was not above suspicion as
to his loyalty; the Duc de Chaulnes, governor of Picardy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
was lazy and negligent; money and men were lacking
for the defence of a divided, discontented, panic-stricken
country.</p>

<p>The first news of the invasion found the King and the
Cardinal absent from Paris as usual in the heat of summer.
They returned at once to the stifling, frantic city.</p>

<p>Then “the great Armand” showed the stuff he was
made of. “Remember, I pray you,” he wrote to the Comte
de Soissons, “on such occasions as these, moments are
worth years.” Paris being always and before all things
a Catholic city, he appealed to her religion. All the
bishops in the kingdom were commanded to hold processions
within and without their cathedrals, with the
special devotions of the Forty Hours. From every church
in Paris and in the whole of France, with every chapel
of convent or monastery, the bells clanged out, calling the
faithful to pray for their country. In his own person,
the Cardinal vowed to the Paris convent of the Filles du
Calvaire, in the Marais, Père Joseph’s favourite foundation,
a large sum of money and a silver lamp to burn perpetually
before Our Lady’s altar.</p>

<p>Whatever his own personal faith may have been, he
knew the spiritual needs of the people. That he did not
fear their angry voices he proved by driving alone, “at
a foot’s pace, without suite and without guards,” through
the wild crowds in the streets, from the Palais-Cardinal
to the Hôtel de Ville, bearing the royal order that the
city trades and companies should assemble for the purpose
of giving their help to the King. His courage triumphed.
The people, says Montglat, “dared not say a word to
him.”</p>

<p>Royal decrees followed thick and fast; their succession
was like the sending round of the Fiery Cross, summoning
men to serve their country. Those Parisians who had
planned to escape John of Werth and his pillaging horde
by flying with all their movable goods to Orléans or some
other city of the west, found the gates of Paris shut against
them. All privileges and exemptions were abolished in the
city. All men capable of bearing arms were ordered to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
present themselves for enrolment, either at the Hôtel de
Ville, where the old Maréchal de la Force sat on the steps
to receive them, or mounted and armed at Saint-Denis.
All the workshops of Paris were closed; all building
stopped; no master of a trade, excepting bakers, butchers,
armourers, gun-makers, saddlers, and the like, might keep
more than one apprentice; the rest, with masons, stone-cutters,
carpenters, artisans of every sort, must serve the
King. From each owner of a coach, a horse was demanded;
and every house in Paris was expected to furnish a man
with belt and sword. The peasants of the surrounding
villages were set to work on new fortifications at Saint-Denis.</p>

<p>A day sufficed to change terror into enthusiasm. On
August 5 representatives of all the trade guilds and syndicates
were received by Louis XIII. in the great gallery of
the Louvre, “and offered him their persons and their goods
with so great gaiety and affection, that most of them
embraced and kissed his knees.” Louis rose to the occasion
and kissed them all, not excepting the chief of the cobblers,
whose guild made the noble gift of 5,000 francs. The
Parliament—not without grudging conditions—the municipality,
the colleges, monasteries, and other bodies, poured
money at the King’s feet: there was enough to pay and
keep, for three months at least, twelve thousand foot and
three thousand horse.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the news that the enemy had taken
Corbie on the Somme, thus drawing alarmingly near to
Amiens, on the direct road to Paris, fanned the flame so
fiercely that “tout le jeune bourgeois,” says Montglat, “à
toute force, vouloit aller à la guerre.” Not many days later,
the King and the Cardinal advanced to Amiens, and a strong
army, commanded by Monsieur and the Comte de Soissons,
held the enemy in effectual check along the banks of the
Somme. By the middle of September, all the actual danger
of invasion was past, though the Imperialists still held
Corbie. John of Werth and his merry men, loaded with
booty, had galloped back across the frontier of Artois.</p>

<p>Corbie was not retaken till November, but the Cardinal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
Infant, his aunt’s successor as ruler of the Netherlands,
with the other Spanish and Imperialist generals, discouraged
by the advance of the French army, had already withdrawn
from French territory; and it seemed, as the autumn
advanced, as if the fortune of war was changing in Richelieu’s
favour. The enemy was repulsed everywhere: in
Burgundy, by Weimar, Condé, and the Cardinal de la
Valette; on the Spanish frontier, where St. Jean de Luz
was taken, but further advance was resisted by the old
Duc d’Épernon and the Comte de Grammont, governors of
Guyenne and of Béarn; on the Morbihan coast, where a
Spanish force, disembarking near Vannes, attacked the
Abbey of Prières. The sturdy monks defended themselves
so gallantly that the country-side had time to rise against
the invaders, who fled back in disorder to their ships.</p>

<p>At this moment of danger, the two young men whom
Richelieu had called to the command of the King’s armies
were busily plotting his destruction. To them and their
like the death of the Minister and the anarchy that must
follow were not only desirable for their own ends, but the
best medicines for the ills of France.</p>

<p>Monsieur and the Comte de Soissons were seldom
friends, except when they joined hands against Richelieu,
and it happened that at this time each was nursing special
grievances: Monsieur, as to his forbidden marriage and the
death of Puylaurens; Soissons, because the Cardinal had
dared to offer him his niece in marriage, had refused him
the command of the army in Alsace, and more recently had
shown distrust by setting Monsieur over him as Commander-in-Chief
of the army on the Oise. There were not
wanting faithful friends who pointed out to both princes
that now was the moment to revenge themselves. The
army was theirs; the Cardinal was at Amiens; the King,
staying at the Château de Demuin, a few miles away, rode
constantly into the city to hold council with his Ministers.
It was natural that the princes in command of the army
should attend the council. The rest was easily thought
out, with the help of M. de Montrésor, a follower of
Monsieur, M. de Saint-Ibal, in M. le Comte’s confidence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
and two “solid men,” Varicarville and Bardouville. These
six conspirators fixed a day on which the Cardinal should
be stabbed to death after the King had left the council.</p>

<p>All went well for their purpose. On the appointed day,
“the council being ended, the King went away with all his
guards, and the Cardinal remained alone in the courtyard
with Monsieur and the Comte de Soissons. Immediately,”
writes the Marquis de Montglat, “Varicarville, who knew
the secret, stationed himself behind the Cardinal, expecting
the signal which Monsieur was to give, while Saint-Ibal
and Bardouville took their stand, one on the right, the
other on the left. But instead of commanding that the
projected deed should be done, Monsieur, seized with fear,
remounted the staircase without a word; while Montrésor,
surprised at the change, followed him, telling him that his
enemy was in his power, and that he had only to speak.”</p>

<p>It was not the first time that Richelieu had owed his
life to Gaston’s temperament. So <i>éperdu</i> was the Prince, so
utterly had his nerve failed him, that he could only mutter
something about “another time,” and escaped as quickly as
possible, leaving the Comte de Soissons, “dans la dernière
confusion,” face to face with Richelieu. Unaware of his
danger, and the King’s brother having disappeared, the
Cardinal bade his other enemy farewell and retired to his
lodging. The fingers of Saint-Ibal, Varicarville, Bardouville,
relaxed on their dagger-hilts, and one may imagine
that these three gentlemen stared rather blankly on each
other as their doomed victim walked away.</p>

<p>When the story became known, which was not immediately,
many persons blamed the Comte de Soissons
that he had not made up for Monsieur’s weakness by
finishing the affair. “He excused himself,” says Montglat,
“by the respect he owed Monsieur, so that he dared
undertake nothing in his presence without his command.”
He was too wise to act alone in such a matter: the position
of Gaston’s cat’s-paw, to be disclaimed and forsaken and
left to the King’s justice, was not attractive. The army
might rally round the heir to the throne in sudden rebellion;
the Comte de Soissons was not equally secure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>Three days later there was another chance, for Richelieu
visited the camp; but he was attended by his own guards,
and the assassination was “judged impossible.” On this
occasion a whisper of the plot reached his ears, and with
his usual fearlessness he spoke of it to the Comte de Soissons,
haughtily reprimanding him.</p>

<p>The princes were frightened, for their plots had gone
beyond the death of Richelieu. They had disloyally done
their best to delay the relief of Corbie; they had attempted
to draw the Duc d’Épernon into the project of a rising,
already favoured by the Duc de Bouillon and others,
the object of which was to lay hold on the government,
to reinstate the Queen-mother, and to make peace with
Spain. They failed; the various successes of the autumn
were against them; the Duc d’Épernon, though two of
his sons were on their side, refused to listen to them.
After the re-taking of Corbie, having returned from the
army to Paris, they were seized with a great fear of
the Cardinal. He was certain to know all; he was of
a temper that never forgave; the Court, they felt assured,
was not a safe place for them. They took counsel with
each other and resolved to fly, at once, on a dark November
night, while Paris was singing and rejoicing over the
good news of victory.</p>

<p>Both princes, before leaving Paris, paid a separate
visit to the Tuileries. There, under the care of M. de
Montglat’s mother, Madame de Saint-Georges, lived
Mademoiselle de Montpensier, Gaston’s daughter, now
nine years old, a person of decided character, and one
of Richelieu’s most hearty haters. The Comte de Soissons
paid great court to this little lady, the richest heiress in
France if not in Europe. Though four years older than
her father and twenty-three years older than herself, and
having failed ten years earlier to run away with her
mother, he proposed to marry her, and Gaston was ready
to consent. This plan was one of the links that now united
them. Mademoiselle herself liked Monsieur le Comte, and
accepted his compliments and sugar-plums with satisfaction:
but at this time she did not understand his object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>It is doubtful if the royal consent would ever have been
given to this marriage. But a curious little passage in the
Cardinal’s own <i>Memoirs</i> shows how keenly he noticed
every detail in the lives of the princes, and on what slight
if sure grounds he accused them of conspiracy.</p>

<p>“The next day at evening, which was the night of the
19th to the 20th, Monsieur and he (M. le Comte) left Paris;
and that it was plotted between them is shown by this:
Monsieur having arrived in Paris, and visiting Mademoiselle
his daughter, Madame de Saint-Georges told him that M. le
Comte had but just gone out. He leaned his head against
a chimney-piece, remained long thoughtful, then said, and
repeated several times, ‘What! Monsieur le Comte is here?
What! He has not gone to Champagne!’ Which showed
plainly that there was a plot between them.”</p>

<p>Disguised and almost alone, the princes retired in
different directions: Monsieur to his castle of Blois, the
Comte de Soissons to neutral ground at Sedan, held by
its sovereigns of the House of Bouillon for more than
a hundred years. From these retreats they sent their
demands and remonstrances to Louis XIII., while on the
other hand they corresponded with the Queen-mother and
with Spain.</p>

<p>Richelieu seems to have treated the discontents of
the Comte de Soissons with some scorn. He allowed
negotiations with him to drag on for some months, and
then advised the King not only to forgive him, but to
allow him to remain four years at Sedan unless he chose
to return to the Court: a leniency for which the Cardinal
has been blamed; dangerous to the State and fatal to
Soissons himself.</p>

<p>As to Monsieur, a mixture of threats and entreaties,
the advance of royal troops to Orléans, the clever management
of M. de Chavigny, the Cardinal’s most trusted agent,
soon brought about a change in his weathercock mind.
He met the King at Orléans in February 1637, “with
many demonstrations of friendship.” Indeed, “dissimulation
went so far, that there appeared to be a sincere
reconciliation between Monsieur and the Cardinal.”</p>

</div>

<p>In Richelieu’s own mind his worst enemies were to be
found among his nearest neighbours. “Les intrigues
de cabinet,” says M. de Montglat, “donnèrent plus
de peine au Cardinal de Richelieu que toute la guerre
étrangère.” Not only mischievous great ladies like the
Duchesse de Chevreuse, but every man or woman who had
anything to do with the Court, were objects of his watchful
suspicion, and to most of them, while they begged his
favour and flocked to his entertainments, he seemed the
cruel ogre, the mysterious sphinx, so long represented in
history.</p>

<p>He never really trusted the King. Louis was fond of
gossip, easily amused by small things, and often attracted
by persons undesirable from Richelieu’s point of view.
And even at his height of power he found it impossible
to carry out the ideal arrangement which would have
hindered any one not bound to his own service from
approaching the King at times such as the <i>petit coucher</i>,
when intimate talk was allowed, and men might even dare
to tell a story against the Eminentissime himself. They
would probably repent; for though Louis might laugh
and enjoy such jokes, he had a way of repeating them to
the Cardinal, if only with a half-childish notion of teasing
him. The consequences to a chattering courtier might be
serious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>The influence of these gentlemen with the King was
seldom really dangerous, and yet the Cardinal was justified
in his distrust, for the majority hated him, and he went
about always with his life in his hand, not because of
ambitious princes alone. Men’s consciences were no protection
to him. For instance, the Abbé de Retz, afterwards
Cardinal and Coadjutor of the Archbishop of Paris, felt
little doubt that he would have done a right action, socially
and politically, had he carried out a plan for killing
Richelieu in the chapel of the Tuileries, at the long-deferred
christening of Mademoiselle de Montpensier.</p>

<p>Over and over again Richelieu tried to confine the
King’s special favour to persons chosen by himself, and
over and over again he failed. It was not so much that
people played him false, as that he found them—men and
women—too proud, too independent, and too faithful to
their order for the place he meant them to fill—that of the
King’s favourites and his own spies. There was Mademoiselle
de Hautefort, with whom Louis fell in love when
she was a beautiful girl of fifteen, brought to Court from
her native province by her grandmother, Madame de la
Flotte, and appointed one of the Queen-mother’s maids-of-honour.
After the “Day of Dupes,” when Marie de Médicis
left France and her household was broken up, Madame
de la Flotte became lady-in-waiting to the young Queen
in the place of Madame du Fargis, whom Richelieu sent
into exile; and Mademoiselle de Hautefort, transferred at
the same time, was specially recommended by Louis to his
wife’s favour.</p>

<p>At first, very naturally, Queen Anne was not pleased.
Marie de Hautefort was in every way a dazzling person.
Madame de Motteville declares that she made a greater
effect at Court than any other beauty. “Her eyes were
blue, large, and full of fire; her teeth white and even;
her complexion had the white and red suitable to a fair
beauty.” Added to this, she had a sharp tongue; she was
high-spirited, “railleuse,” and by no means soft-hearted.</p>

<p>Louis XIII.’s love-affairs contrast curiously with those
of his father. Nothing could be more innocent, more purely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
platonic, than his devotion to Mademoiselle de Hautefort.
He hardly dared approach her; his talk was of dogs and
of birds; and yet he showed the stormy jealousy and the
sulks and humours of a passionate lover, and spent hours
in writing songs and music for his lady. She disputed
with him freely and laughed at him unmercifully.</p>

<p>At the beginning Richelieu encouraged this singular
affection. But after about three years he saw reason to
change his mind. Mademoiselle de Hautefort was not
inclined to act as his political agent, and she had soon
given the loyalty of a warm and generous nature to her
mistress, the Queen, whom she saw neglected by Louis
and subject to the tyranny of the Cardinal. This is to say
that the woman most admired by the King had joined
the Spanish party at Court and was rightly counted by
Richelieu among his enemies.</p>

<p>It cost him little trouble to drive Mademoiselle de
Hautefort out of favour—at least for a time. When Louis
had become slightly tired of his quarrels with the fair
beauty and slightly chilled by her friendship with the
Queen, it was made easy for him to find consolation in
the dark eyes of Louise de la Fayette, a cousin of Père
Joseph, whose family was supposed to be devoted to the
Cardinal.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de la Fayette was as good and gentle as
she was lovely; in the varied records of the French Court
there exists no sweeter figure. During two years she and
the eccentric King adored each other with a tender affection
and mutual confidence quite absent from the Hautefort
affair; yet this, like the other, never passed the bounds
of friendship. It went so far, however, that the girl’s
conscience was alarmed, and she began to think of taking
refuge in a convent.</p>

<p>The idea was not unwelcome to Cardinal de Richelieu.
The Court was full of his spies, who warned him that
Mademoiselle de la Fayette’s intimate talk with the King
was not to his advantage; that she was inspired by Père
Caussin, the royal confessor, to speak to Louis in favour
of his mother, his wife, his brother, and all the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
victims of a warlike, heretical policy; that she was encouraged
by her uncle the Bishop of Limoges and her
brother the Chevalier de la Fayette, to set him against
the Cardinal; that the Bishop had even been heard to say,
“When the Cardinal is ruined, we will do this and that.
As for me, I shall inhabit the Hôtel de Richelieu.”</p>

<p>The Court was buzzing with intrigues all through 1636,
the “year of Corbie,” while the King still enjoyed, as far
as possible, the society of the only woman who had ever
loved him for his own sake. Mademoiselle de la Fayette,
torn between conscience and affection, was dragged one
way and the other by two sets of advisers, each headed
by a dignified ecclesiastic moved by reasons beyond mere
anxiety for her welfare and that of the King. The Père
Carré, Superior of the Dominicans in Paris and a favourite
director of Court ladies, was one of Richelieu’s chief spies
and most devoted servants. Mademoiselle de la Fayette
came to him for counsel. He encouraged her scruples
and blessed her vocation: “Il faisait parler Dieu,” says
M. Cousin, “selon l’intérêt et au commandement de
Richelieu.”</p>

<p>On the other hand Père Caussin, a Jesuit, and apparently
an honest man, took advantage of his place as the
King’s confessor to advise Mademoiselle de la Fayette to
remain at Court. He saw no reason why Louis should
be deprived of a perfectly innocent friendship for the sake
of foolish scruples and a half-imaginary vocation. Such
an opinion, if disinterested, would have been worthy of
all respect; but at the French Court, divided between
Richelieu’s spies and Richelieu’s enemies, this was almost
impossible. The reasons that had moved Cardinal de
Bérulle and the brothers Marillac, the grievances of the
Queen-mother, of the Pope and of the princes, all found
voice in Père Caussin. He was closely allied, too, with
another distinguished Jesuit, Père Monot, the confessor
of Christine, Duchess of Savoy, who was at this very time
in Paris working against Richelieu in the interests of Spain.
Considering all this, it is no great wonder that Père Caussin
presently found himself disgraced and banished to Brittany,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
a harmless Jesuit of eighty years old being appointed
royal confessor in his place. It seems that Richelieu did
not wish to break the tradition which gave the care of
the King’s conscience to that Order.</p>

<p>Tired of intrigue, pushed on by Père Carré and her
own doubts, Louise de la Fayette entered the Convent of
the Visitation in the Rue Saint-Antoine, in May 1637.
For some months the King continued to visit her there,
until Richelieu, whose influence had been a good deal
shaken by her arguments, had regained his personal
power, and Mademoiselle de Hautefort, still at Court, her
old dominion.</p>

<p>The tragi-comedy known as “the Affair of the Val-de-Grâce,”
which played itself out in the summer of 1637,
proved that Richelieu’s star was still in the ascendant.
The war with Spain had added fresh distress to Queen
Anne’s position, so long a false and lonely one. The secret
sympathy of half the Court and of all the malcontents in
the kingdom did not compensate the Queen for the loss
of her friends, exiled one by one as Richelieu came to
suspect them, or for the entire separation from her own
family and its allies in Austria, the Netherlands, and
Lorraine. The Queen did not easily resign herself. In
spite of <i>espionnage</i>, she wrote and sent letters to her
brothers, the King of Spain and the Cardinal-Infant, as
well as to Madame de Chevreuse, living in banishment at
Tours. These letters were written in a refuge to which
spies did not penetrate: the Benedictine Abbey of the
Val-de-Grâce in the Faubourg St. Jacques. The Abbess,
of Spanish origin, was a devoted servant of the Queen.</p>

<p>It is no insult to Richelieu’s patriotism to believe that
he had never pounced on smaller game with equal satisfaction.
The famous letters themselves, if we may believe
Madame de Motteville, contained no actual treason against
the King or the State; but they did contain “railleries”
against the Cardinal, and in any case they were written
to the enemies of France, and belonged to the political
opposition so long irreconcilable, which he crushed more
sternly every year he lived. We may think what we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
please about his more personal motives of spite and
revenge: that he had made love to the Queen and that
she had laughed at him seemed to the gossips of the time
a sufficient explanation of everything. The Cardinal, they
said, wished to send her back to Spain, to divorce her from
the King, to marry him to Madame de Combalet! In the
following year that much-talked-of lady was consoled for
the loss of so many great matches by being created
Duchesse d’Aiguillon in her own right. Her uncle paid
an enormous sum of money for the title and the estates
belonging to it.</p>

<p>The Queen’s troubles in the summer of 1637 began with
the intercepting, by Richelieu’s people, of a letter in cypher
which she had written to Madame de Chevreuse. The
bearer, La Porte, her valet-de-chambre, was the person
to whom she trusted all her secret correspondence.
Suddenly thrown into the Bastille, examined first by
Richelieu’s terrible agents and then by the Cardinal
himself, threatened with torture and death, the faithful
man refused to say one word that could incriminate his
royal mistress. Even the Cardinal admired his fidelity.</p>

<p>It was in August, and the Court was at Chantilly. The
Queen in her alarm first denied everything, solemnly and
on oath; then thought it prudent to make some kind of
confession. She sent for the Cardinal, who came accompanied
by his two chief secretaries, M. de Chavigny and
M. de Noyers. Madame de Sénecé, the mistress of her
household, was in attendance on the Queen.</p>

<p>The Cardinal, according to himself, was respectful,
fatherly, but severe. When the Queen began to assure
him of the harmlessness of her letters, he said at once
that he did not believe her, but promised her his own
faithful service and the King’s forgiveness if she would
confess everything. On this, Anne sent the witnesses out
of the room and remained alone with Richelieu. We have
only his word for what passed: that the Queen, speaking
“with much displeasure and confusion,” confessed to a
correspondence with Spain and with Flanders, carried on
by secret means and in terms which might justly displease<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
the King; that she exclaimed several times, “Quelle bonté
faut-il que vous ayez, Monsieur le Cardinal!”; that she
protested her eternal gratitude, saying, “Give me your
hand,” while holding out her own, famous for its beauty;
which the Cardinal respectfully refused to touch.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp65" id="010" style="max-width: 42.625em;">
  <img class="w75" src="images/010.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">ANNE OF AUSTRIA, CONSORT OF LOUIS XIII</p>

<p class="center small">FROM A MINIATURE AT SOUTH KENSINGTON MUSEUM</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>He made her write and sign her confession, and then
caused the King to bestow a formal forgiveness, not
sweetened by a list of requirements as to her future
conduct. She was to visit no convents and to write no
letters without the King’s permission, her maids and her
ladies-in-waiting, especially “Fillandre, première femme de
chambre,” who had charge of her writing-desk, being set
as spies and gaolers over her. Not much wonder that the
lively little niece, Mademoiselle de Montpensier, visiting
Chantilly in that disturbed month of August, found the
Queen in bed, ill with fear and worry.</p>

<p>For this was not the end of it. The Cardinal was dissatisfied,
still suspecting concealment. La Porte in his
prison was once more threatened with torture. A spy was
sent to him—one of the Queen’s officers, gained over by
Richelieu and Laffemas. He brought a supposed message
from the Queen to La Porte, commanding him to tell all he
knew. But if Anne’s enemies were clever and resourceful,
so also were her friends. The romantic courage of
Mademoiselle de Hautefort and of the Chevalier de Jars,
himself confined in the Bastille, had found a way of conveying
a letter to La Porte, warning him of the extent of the
Queen’s confessions. He was thus prepared to tell the same
story—all of which seems to justify Richelieu’s suspicion.</p>

<p>Madame de Motteville says that the remembrance of
those summer weeks at Chantilly “faisoit horreur à la
Reine.” She was within an ace of following her mother-in-law’s
example in a flight from France. Mademoiselle de
Hautefort and the Prince de Marcillac—afterwards Duc de
la Rochefoucauld—were ready to ride off with her to
Brussels. Her life at the Court had become unendurable.
Richelieu brought forward the terrors of the law in the
person of Chancellor Séguier, who not only examined the
Queen “like a criminal,” but made a thorough search at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
the Abbey of the Val-de-Grâce, where her letters and papers
were supposed to be hidden. Either because the Abbess
was fearless and loyal, or because there was nothing to find,
the Chancellor found no papers of a later date than 1630.</p>

<p>So the storm passed over. Richelieu could prove
nothing; the King and Queen were reconciled; and the
only consequence was a fresh exile for Madame de Chevreuse,
who rode for her life from Tours and crossed the Pyrenees
into Spain.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Hautefort remained in favour for two
more years; the Queen valued her friendship, and the King,
after his final parting with Mademoiselle de la Fayette, had
returned to his old love; she became a lady-in-waiting, with
the title of <i>Madame</i> and other privileges. But Richelieu
was still afraid of her. Rather cautiously and slowly, from
1637 till the end of 1639, he was working for her ruin. In
the Queen’s very household he had a spy, long unsuspected
and exceedingly clever at her odious trade, Mademoiselle
de Chémerault, a young maid-of-honour, an intimate friend
of Madame de Hautefort. From the most private interior
of the Court, this girl reported every word and deed to a
Madame Maline, who conveyed the information direct to
Richelieu in letters which still exist, a mine of ancient
gossip written in the curious jargon used by him in his
secret notes. Everybody has a nickname: the Cardinal
himself, in these notes, is sometimes <i>Amadeo</i>, sometimes
<i>l’Oracle</i>; the King and Queen are <i>Céphale</i> and <i>Procris</i>;
Madame de Hautefort is <i>l’Aurore</i>, Madame d’Aiguillon
<i>Vénus</i>, Mademoiselle de la Fayette, <i>la Délaissée</i>, Mademoiselle
de Chémerault herself, <i>le bon Ange</i>. These letters
warned the Cardinal of all the loves and hatreds, the private
and public discontents and desires, which moved the Queen
and her friends, and kept him in touch with every detail of
the stormy yet affectionate intercourse between Madame de
Hautefort and the King. Her empire, if only intermittent,
was dangerous; the more so, because she was known to be
on friendly terms with the Comte de Soissons and with
Monsieur.</p>

<p>Richelieu believed in “the expulsive power of a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
affection.” Young Henry d’Effiat, Marquis de Cinq-Mars,
was brought to Court by him with the definite object of
distracting the King from the society of Madame de Hautefort.
This plan being on the way to succeed, the Cardinal
took advantage of one of the King’s journeys, when the
lady was not there to plead her own cause, to accuse her of
being as dangerous an <i>intrigante</i> as Madame de Chevreuse,
adding that he could no longer endure this fighting in the
dark, and that Louis must choose between Madame de
Hautefort and himself. With some show of regret, the
King yielded. Madame de Hautefort was banished from
Court, and retired to her grandmother’s country estates.
Four years later, when Richelieu and Louis XIII. were
dead, she was recalled and honoured among the old friends
who had been faithful to the Regent in adversity.</p>

<p>The Queen’s own troubles and humiliations came to an
end in September 1638. On the 5th—Richelieu’s birthday
and also the date on which he became Cardinal, Duke, and
Peer—the long-wished-for Dauphin was born at Saint-Germain.
All France rejoiced; the towns, especially Paris,
held high festival, with singing of <i>Te Deum</i>, firing of cannon,
ringing of bells, keeping open house for all comers. The
Cardinal, who was in Picardy, wrote rapturous letters to
the King and Queen.</p>

<p>“I hope and believe that God has given Monseigneur
le Dauphin to Christendom to appease its troubles, and
to bring to it the blessing of peace. I vow to him, from
his birth, the same passionate devotion I have always had
for the King and for your Majesty, whose faithful servant I
am and shall be eternally....”</p>

<p>The Cardinal’s rejoicing was sincere. In the birth of
the future Louis XIV. he rightly saw the triumph of his
own policy as well as the saving of France from the
danger, which the King’s weak health made imminent, of
falling into the hands of Gaston d’Orléans and his crew.
Two years later, in 1640, the birth of Philippe was an
additional security.</p>

<p>But the joy of September 1638 was soon followed by
one of the most real sorrows of Richelieu’s life. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
December he lost Père Joseph, his adviser and shadow,
the intimate friend of thirty years. Through all difficulties
and changes the two men had worked together. Both
were hard and pitiless politicians, driving at the same ends
in Church and State. François du Tremblay, the monk,
was the more imaginative, the more enthusiastic, and the
less human of the two. He was not, like Richelieu,
personally ambitious, and he lived the simple life of a friar,
while his keen cleverness and ready, fearless resource
made him the first of diplomatists. If he was eager for the
Cardinal’s Hat steadily refused by Pope Urban VIII., it was
because of the advantages this honour would have brought
to his beloved Capuchin Order.</p>

<p>Père Joseph had been ill for some time at his convent
in Paris when the Cardinal wrote to beg him to come
to Rueil, offering to send his own litter that he might
travel comfortably. This offer he accepted. Richelieu
received him with much affection, and at first he seemed
to rally: he dictated a circular letter to his congregation
of the Filles du Calvaire, answered letters from missionaries
in the East, and listened with pleasure to a book describing
the exploits of Godefroy de Bouillon in the Holy Land;
the spirit of a crusader was in him to the last. Another
seizure brought him very near death, but he lingered
till December 18, while Richelieu tried to cheer his
“Ezéchiéli’s” failing ears with news of the victories by
which France was now reaping the fruit of so much effort
and suffering.</p>

<p>With great funeral pomp the Capuchin was borne back
to Paris and buried in his convent church in the Rue St.
Honoré, where for nearly a hundred and seventy years
his stately Latin epitaph, composed by Cardinal de
Richelieu, told the world how he had lived in the midst
of splendour and riches, austere and poor. His bones
lay beside those of the famous Père Ange, Duc de Joyeuse
and Marshal of France. In 1804, when the already
profaned church was pulled down and the Rue Mont-Thabor
built over its site, their remains were removed
to the cemetery of Montmartre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p>Paris of the streets made her own epitaph for Père
Joseph:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="fr">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Cy gît au chœur de cette Eglise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sa petite Eminence grise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et quand au Seigneur il plaira</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Son Eminence rouge y gira.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Cardinal’s Hat desired by Richelieu for his old
friend was eventually given to Jules Mazarin, the clever
Italian statesman who, originally an agent of the Vatican
but now naturalised in France, had risen so high in
Richelieu’s opinion that he appointed him in Père Joseph’s
place one of his principal Secretaries of State.</p>

<p>Mazarin was in fact a peacemaker between Richelieu
and the Pope, and his promotion to be Cardinal was
really a sign of their reconciliation. The Church of France
had been supported by Rome in resistance to the new
laws and revived taxes and the many complicated exactions
made upon her great possessions in aid of the war. The
cry of sacrilege rose high; the archbishops and bishops
were divided, the majority eager to resist a Minister whom
they called “tyrant,” “apostate,” and other hard names,
the minority ready to hail Cardinal de Richelieu as “the
Head of the Gallican Church.” There was actually a talk
of appointing him Patriarch. Why not? said the Jesuits,
wisely respectful of the civil power. Books and violent
pamphlets were written on both sides of the question.</p>

<p>The Pope refused to issue bulls for the appointment
of French bishops so long as the French Government held
on its present course. Richelieu was prepared to do
without them. The King refused to receive the Nuncio,
or to recognize his authority. The Pope absolutely
refused to confirm Richelieu’s own election as Abbot-General
of the Orders of Cîteaux and Prémontré, or to
countenance his project of advanced reform in his own
Order of Cluny. A private quarrel in Rome made matters
worse; one of the French Ambassador’s gentlemen was
killed, and the ambassador’s wrath irritated the Pope into
forbidding any funeral honours to be paid in Rome to
Richelieu’s lieutenant, the soldier-Cardinal de la Valette,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
who died at Rivoli in the midst of his Savoyard campaign
of 1639.</p>

<p>The quarrel was at last made up: for the French
Church, as for the government, it was really a question
of money, and both agreed to a compromise. Richelieu’s
Finance Secretaries withdrew some part of their immense
demands; the clergy, very unwillingly, granted the
rest; Urban VIII. was appeased, and Mazarin became a
Cardinal.</p>

<p>If Richelieu opposed the Pope, the friend of the Hapsburgs,
and asserted the liberty of the Gallican Church in
such matters, for instance, as the annulling of Monsieur’s
marriage, he was neither unorthodox, nor unfriendly to
different forms of religious effort. The great charities of
the seventeenth century grew and flourished under his
shadow. The spirit of St. François de Sales lived on in
the Order of the Visitation, devoted to the sick and the
poor. Vincent de Paul, with his Mission of Lazarist
Fathers and his Sisters of Charity, bringing light into dark
places and helping the miserable, both in Paris and in
the deserts of the country, was a familiar and beautiful
figure through most of Richelieu’s reign. Monsieur
Vincent’s great Mission work, the training of the younger
clergy, also nobly carried on by the congregations of
the Oratory, of St. Nicolas du Chardonnet and of Saint-Sulpice,
had lain very near Richelieu’s own heart in his
young days.</p>

<p>The Cardinal extended his powerful protection to the
teaching Orders, Jesuits, Ursulines, and others; and the
reformed Benedictines of Saint-Maur, so famous for
ecclesiastical and historical learning, owed their distinction
largely to him. He did very much, indeed, towards
the reform and discipline of the regular clergy, and with
a longer life he might have removed many of the abuses
which spoiled their religious ideal. But his chief and
immediate object was to nationalize the Orders, and to
bring them under the same authority with France as a
whole.</p>

<p>“A central and supreme authority”; absolutism; obedience:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
these were the root-principles of Richelieu’s rule.
He hated original, independent thought or action, in Church
or State; it was of the nature of rebellion. Personal quite
as much as political, this imperious, dominating temper was
the chief secret of his triumph in matters where reason
and equity have in the long run decided against him; for
instance, the many cases in which he appointed his own
judges and tribunals to try his prisoners, the slower and
often fairer proceedings of the parliamentary law-courts
being found unbearable by his impatient and positive
mind.</p>

<p>The same dominating spirit explains Richelieu’s treatment
of his old friend the Abbé de Saint-Cyran. He could
be tolerant of Protestants: their private heresies mattered
little, as long as their public conduct was loyal. But the
advance of Jansenist opinions within the French Church
was another thing. In the case of M. de Saint-Cyran, as
strong-willed a personage as the Cardinal himself, it meant
a very powerful spiritual influence not quite strictly orthodox,
with a stiff morality and an independence of mind
which judged and condemned much of the Cardinal’s own
theory and practice. He did his best to win Saint-Cyran,
whose learning and high character were of European fame.
But bishoprics would not tempt the man who did not
choose to range himself among the Cardinal’s slaves, who,
though none too loyal to the Pope, declared openly that
the Church could not annul Monsieur’s marriage, and who
agreed with Jansenius in denouncing the alliance of France
with heretics.</p>

<p>The great director and glory of Port-Royal was imprisoned
at Vincennes in 1638, and remained there till after
the death of Richelieu. The Eminentissime could not
afford to tolerate a man the watchwords of whose spirit
were independence, boldness, and truth. “He is more
dangerous,” he said, “than half a dozen armies.”</p>

</div>

<p>For the last three or four years of Cardinal de Richelieu’s
life his figure stands out against a horizon
glowing with the fires of victory.</p>

<p>After the death of Bernard of Saxe-Weimar in 1639,
Richelieu’s diplomacy transferred his army and his lieutenants
to Louis XIII.’s service, and the conquest of Alsace
for France was the consequence. The Comte de Guébriant,
the brilliant soldier who succeeded Weimar in the command,
carried the war into Germany, and by a series of
victories, in conjunction with the Swedes, “made the
Emperor tremble in Ratisbon.”</p>

<p>In the Spanish Netherlands, the Maréchal de la Meilleraye
took Arras after a two months’ siege, and gave back
to France the ancient province of Artois. In northern Italy
the campaign was more troublesome. The princes of
Savoy, the new Duke being a child, disputed the regency
with their sister-in-law Christine of France, and allied
themselves with Spain. Christine herself, influenced by
Père Monot, had leanings towards the imperial side, and it
was not till the Spaniards had swept over Piedmont and
taken Turin and besieged Casale that she brought herself
to turn for help to Richelieu. Even then, jealous for her
son’s independence and her own, she would not consent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
send him to France for education, much less to hand over
his whole dominions to be occupied by her brother’s armies.
Her obstinacy triumphed, for Richelieu withdrew his conditions
and sent the Comte d’Harcourt to relieve Casale
and retake Turin; operations which were brilliantly carried
out. The Spaniards were driven out of the country; the
Savoyard princes, finding the fortunes of war against them,
submitted to the Duchess-regent, who returned victorious
to her capital. France gained, besides a firm alliance with
Savoy, a paramount position in North Italy.</p>

<p>Spain was in trouble by land and by sea. Her fleets
were defeated and half destroyed by the French in the
Mediterranean and the Bay of Biscay, and by the Dutch,
Richelieu’s allies, in the English Channel. The old province
of Catalonia, with the frontier counties of Roussillon and
Cerdagne, revolted against the burdens heaped on them by
Olivarez and offered their allegiance to the King of France.
French armies overran Roussillon, besieged Perpignan, and
driving on over the mountains, fought side by side with the
rebels in Catalonia. Before the death of Richelieu almost
all the province was in French hands, and his brother-in-law,
the Marquis de Brézé, had reigned for some months as
Viceroy at Barcelona. It looked as though the south-eastern
frontier of France would be extended, as in the
days of Charlemagne, to the Ebro. The power of Spain
was furthered handicapped by the revolt of Portugal.
Encouraged by France, she claimed and seized her independence,
recalled her old royal family of Braganza to
the throne, and added one more to the active allies of
Richelieu.</p>

<p>The tragic end of the Comte de Soissons was a more
personal triumph for the Cardinal. Monsieur le Comte
had spent his time at Sedan in weaving plots with the
Duc de Bouillon and the wild Archbishop of Rheims, now
Duc de Guise, while waiting for some turn of events that
might restore his fortunes. In the summer of 1641 Richelieu
decided to break up this nest of conspirators. He
required the Duc de Bouillon to withdraw his hospitality,
and ordered the Comte de Soissons to banish himself to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
Venice. Both refused. It was now open war between
them and Richelieu. They tried, but failed, to draw
Gaston d’Orléans into their quarrel; for once he was
prudent in time. They published a manifesto, as usual
declaring themselves loyal subjects of Louis XIII., moved
solely by a patriotic desire to get rid of the tyrant Minister.
“Pour le Roy, contre le Cardinal,” was the device on their
banners.</p>

<p>They prepared to invade France with a small army of
imperial troops, supported by Duke Charles of Lorraine,
who was now prepared to break his last treaty with
Richelieu. They were met by a royal army commanded
by the brave but lethargic Coligny, Maréchal de Châtillon.
He was rather seriously beaten by the rebels in the first
and only engagement of the little campaign. But this
news, which cost Richelieu a few hours of great wrath
and anxiety, was followed immediately by other news
which made it of no importance: “the bitter and the
sweet,” His Eminence wrote to M. Bouthillier—“the
sweet” being the death of Soissons, who was shot by an
unknown hand in the confusion of that victorious skirmish
through the woods of La Marfée, on the left bank of the
Meuse.</p>

<p>Richelieu had a right to rejoice, for one of his trusted
spies wrote to him: “If M. le Comte had not been killed,
he would have been welcomed by the half of Paris ...
so says every one ... and that all France would have
joined him, because of the <i>sol au livre</i> and the other
vexations laid upon the people, who are very malcontent.”</p>

<p>The revolt died with Soissons, for neither Bouillon nor
Guise bore a name to be followed far. Bouillon submitted
and was pardoned; Guise fled to Brussels, and did not
return till the days of the “bonne Régence.” The Cardinal
persuaded Louis—with difficulty, they say—not to wreak
his vengeance on the Prince’s dead body, but to restore
him to his mother. Some time afterwards His Eminence
paid a visit of condolence to Madame la Comtesse. “Elle
étoit sur son lict, et ne respondit aux complimens que par
ses larmes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>The death of Louis de Bourbon freed Richelieu not
only from a political and personal enemy, but from one
of the proudest of the princes who scorned the lofty social
claims of himself and his family. These reached their
highest point in 1641. His uncle, Amador de la Porte,
was Grand Prior of France, and enjoyed several rich
governments. His pious and eccentric brother, Alphonse,
was Archbishop of Lyons, Primate of Gaul, and Cardinal.
Richelieu could not make a statesman of this worthy
ecclesiastic, but those who failed to treat him with the
honour due to a great prince of the Church found themselves
in disgrace. The Cardinal’s first cousin, Charles
de la Porte, Marquis de la Meilleraye, was a Marshal of
France, Grand Master of the Artillery with his residence
at the Arsenal, and a Knight of the Order. One of the
Cardinal’s favourite commanders, he distinguished himself
in many campaigns, and, though a good man in the
main, was said to have enriched himself from the public
finances. He afterwards succeeded Richelieu as Governor
of Brittany.</p>

<p>The Cardinal did his best to pour honours on the
families of his two sisters, Françoise and Nicole. Madame
de Combalet, now Duchesse d’Aiguillon and all-powerful
with her uncle, had one brother, François de Vignerot,
Marquis du Pont-de-Courlay, who ruined himself in spite
of splendid appointments and earned terrible scoldings
from the Cardinal, who paid his debts and as far as
possible disinherited him. It was his eldest son, Armand
Jean, born in 1629, whom the Cardinal adopted as heir to
his name, arms, and titles, and the greater part of his
possessions. This boy took the name of Du Plessis, and
succeeded to the duchy, peerage, and estates of Richelieu.
The title of Marquis de Richelieu passed to the younger
brother, Jean Baptiste Amador de Vignerot, and his descendants
succeeded in time to the duchy of Aiguillon, left
by Madame d’Aiguillon to her niece, her brother’s only
daughter, Mademoiselle d’Agénois.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Maillé-Brézé, whose unhappy wife died
in 1635, accepted enormous benefits from his brother-in-law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
without much show of thanks. In Richelieu’s last
years he held some of the highest military commands in
the kingdom, and was too clever and capable not to acquit
himself well, though with airs of ennui and fits of temper.
His children did not inherit his intelligence. His son,
Armand Jean, Duc de Fronsac, failed to distinguish himself
in the navy; his daughter, Claire Clémence, a dull little
girl with a touch of the heroic, hardly seemed equal to
her fate—that of linking the family of Richelieu with the
blood royal of France.</p>

<p>The brilliant matches made by the Cardinal’s cousins,
Mesdemoiselles de Pontchâteau and others, had already
proved that, as Montglat says, “the greatest were happy
and honoured to be allied with him.” Among these
“greatest” was the first prince of the blood, the Prince
de Condé. He had been Richelieu’s faithful and rather
servile follower ever since their reconciliation in 1626,
being shrewd enough to see that this was the path to
wealth and power. So early as 1633, when Mademoiselle
de Brézé was only five years old, he had proposed a
marriage between her and his son Louis, Duc d’Enghien,
and the Cardinal had accepted the offer. In 1641 the
marriage was celebrated in Paris with great magnificence.
The bridegroom was sulky and unwilling: already, at
twenty, he was a fighting hero, a man of the world, and
desperately in love with Mademoiselle du Vigean. To him
his childish little wife was profoundly uninteresting. But
the match gave keen pleasure to Cardinal de Richelieu;
and the Prince de Condé proved his satisfaction by offering
to marry his daughter, Mademoiselle de Bourbon (the
famous Duchesse de Longueville), to young Armand de
Maillé-Brézé. The Cardinal replied, according to Mademoiselle
de Montpensier, with dignity and good sense:
“Qu’il vouloit bien donner des demoiselles à des princes, et
non pas des gentilhommes à des princesses.”</p>

<p>But there was the other side of the shield. There
were dark shadows behind the victories and social
triumphs which lifted France and her great Minister so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>high in Europe. During Richelieu’s last years his armies
were sometimes forced to other work than that of fighting
Imperialists. The provincial government of France had
become, in many quarters, little but a hard and extortionate
system of tax-collecting, and the richest districts
naturally fared the worst. When Bullion, Bouthillier’s
colleague in the management of the finances, wrote
despairingly in the autumn of 1639 to Chavigny, “Nous
sommes maintenant au fond du pot,” and added his fear
that foreign war might bring about civil war, the great
fertile province of Normandy, ruined by injustice, tyranny,
and enormous taxation, was actually in open rebellion;
the “Va-nu-pieds” were marching in bands over the
country, murdering tax-gatherers, destroying Government
property, while even the tradespeople of Rouen
and Caen rose and burned the houses and <i>bureaux</i> of
the royal officers and killed them and their servants in
the streets.</p>

<p>Richelieu wrote very sharply to his financiers on their
mismanagement and ill-judged severity. As to the
Normandy affair, they must remedy that “by prudence
and skill,” as best they could: no troops could be spared
to help them. However, His Eminence had to yield
to necessity, and Colonel de Gassion, with 6,000 men,
marched into Normandy, occupied Caen and Rouen, put
hundreds of peasants to the sword, hanged or sent to
the galleys hundreds more, while those who escaped fled
the country. The whole population was disarmed; the
Norman Parliament ceased for the time to exist, and
the province had to pay a heavy indemnity besides all
the arrears of the taxes it had refused, which were
reimposed in the fullest rigour. The towns were deprived
of all their liberties and privileges, their municipal courts
being suspended; for two years Normandy was governed
by a Royal Commission, and lay in deep disgrace under
a kind of martial law. All this was an example—extreme,
certainly—of Richelieu’s domestic government, the wrong
side of his glory.</p>

<p>The Norman revolt worried him terribly; the more
so as he knew that it was instigated by his enemies;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
not Spain alone, but England, hindered by internal
troubles from taking an open part in the war. Richelieu
had indeed earned little gratitude from Charles I. His
creation of a navy, his colonising and trading policy, had
for years made France a dangerous rival to England in
home and foreign seas, and of late his far-seeing statesmanship,
by encouraging the rebel party in Scotland,
had helped to bias the King in favour of his mother-in-law’s
quarrel. Marie de Médicis was an honoured guest
at the English Court for nearly three years, from 1638
to 1641.</p>

<p>This old friend and enemy of the Cardinal did not
survive him. She died, poor and miserable, at Cologne,
in the summer of 1642: her children reigning in all
Christendom, she had not an inch of earth to call her
own. The Cardinal, lying ill at Tarascon, caused a solemn
service to be held in her memory.</p>

<p>Another deepening shadow on his last years was the
state of his health. In addition to the old ills of frequent
fever and headache, he now suffered from painful and
distressing complaints which kept him constantly in the
hands of physician or surgeon; and the consequences
were much depression, irritability, and suspiciousness,
with increased hardness and severity to those who
offended him, so that great and small feared him more
than ever and loved him less. In this condition of mind
and body he entered on the year 1642, during which he
was to encounter his last conspiracy, to suffer his last
doubts of the King’s trust and favour, and triumphantly
to end his career.</p>

<p>Already, in the autumn and winter of 1641, there was
mortal enmity between Richelieu and the young favourite
he had given to Louis XIII. The success of Cinq-Mars
was complete: the King could not pass a day without
him; he was Grand Equerry, cut a splendid figure at
Court, was popular and gay, made love to great ladies,
dreamed of marrying Princess Marie de Gonzague and
climbing to the highest rank in the kingdom. If the
friendship of the King had stormy episodes which might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
have warned a less vain and confident courtier against
putting his trust in princes, there were also times when
Louis was ready to listen with grim enjoyment and even
with sympathy to the young man’s rash talk against the
Cardinal. Richelieu had not found in Cinq-Mars the tool
he expected, and revenged himself sharply by word and
deed. He treated “M. le Grand” with scornful anger
as an impertinent boy, laughed at his social ambitions
and barred his access to the royal Council.</p>

<p>Cinq-Mars swore vengeance; his talk was of “poniards
and pistols.” He had been a secret ally of the Sedan
conspirators; now, with a few confederates, among whom
were his intimate friends M. de Fontrailles and M. de Thou,
he began seriously to plot the destruction of the Cardinal.
The first idea was simply assassination; but the dangers
were obvious, and François de Thou had a troublesome
conscience. They widened their plan into a political
conspiracy, including Monsieur, the lately pardoned Duc
de Bouillon, and the Spanish government. De Thou
shrank also from high treason, but he was not the man
to betray his friends; he had been injured in his career
by Richelieu, and also, private reasons apart, regarded
him as “the oppressor of France and the perturbator of
Europe.” His hope seems to have been that Louis himself
might be induced by his favourite’s strong influence
to dismiss his Minister.</p>

<p>If this ever seemed probable, it was in the early days of
1642. The King and the Cardinal were both ill when they
left Paris for Roussillon, the Spanish campaign being in
full swing. They travelled separately, the royal party a
day in advance; the Cardinal’s suite was so large that the
same night’s lodging was seldom enough for both, and the
progress was slow. Leaving Paris in January, they reached
Narbonne in the second week of March.</p>

<p>Cinq-Mars had not wasted his time. He had gone so
far, they say, with the bored, discontented King, as to
suggest not only the Cardinal’s disgrace, but his murder.
Louis listened, says Aubery, with horror; yet he neither
warned the Cardinal nor took any steps to defend him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
He wrote to him indeed in the first days of March, when
the weary journey was nearly over, “songés seulement
à vostre persone”; but this might naturally refer to
Richelieu’s health, which was growing worse every day.
The King saw no real danger, probably, in the irresponsible
chatter of M. le Grand. He was half amused; he was often
very impatient of his Minister’s domineering temper, and
not unwilling to use his favourite as a safety-valve. In
that there was nothing new; but all the history shows
that the King leaned on the Cardinal’s genius, trusted
him, if he did not love him, and had too much good
sense ever seriously to think of depriving the kingdom
of his services.</p>

<p>Cinq-Mars was discouraged, at least as to the violent
death he proposed for the Cardinal. Not only was the
King a little cold, for his favour was beginning to wane,
but Monsieur and the Duc de Bouillon, on whose presence
and help he had counted, were prudently careful to keep at
a distance. He placed all his hopes, therefore, on the secret
treaty with Spain, which was actually brought to him at
Narbonne. Fontrailles, disguised as a Capuchin friar, had
carried it to Madrid for the signature of Olivarez. In it
the King of Spain promised an army of 17,000 men and a
large sum of money to Monsieur, the Duc de Bouillon, and
Cinq-Mars, who were to command this force under the
Emperor and to hold Sedan in his name while Spain invaded
France. All the French conquests of the last four years
were to be restored, and the work of Richelieu entirely
undone. The precious document was sent to Monsieur for
his signature, which he, with newly developed caution, was
in no hurry to give. Richelieu had offered the command
in North Italy to the third chief conspirator, Bouillon. His
brother, the Vicomte de Turenne, always of stainless
loyalty, was fighting in Roussillon with the Maréchal de
la Meilleraye and the young Duc d’Enghien.</p>

<p>The King passed on to the siege of Perpignan, leaving
the Cardinal seriously ill at Narbonne. His sufferings at
this time, both of mind and body, were very great, and may
be traced through the letters which, day by day, he dictated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
and sent to M. de Noyers, his Secretary for War, in attendance
on the King. Louis was himself far from well, but
the Cardinal’s constant, eager inquiries, during this enforced
separation, betray anxieties beyond the matter of health;
for Cinq-Mars was always at his post, and if Richelieu
knew nothing yet of the Spanish treaty, he suspected everything
as to his enemy’s personal designs. The thought of
these, and the agony of clinging to that power which, in the
last resort, depended on the favour of the King, were worse
to the strong spirit than days and nights of pain caused by
cruel sores and barbarous remedies.</p>

<p>Early in May he writes from Narbonne: “Unluckily,
though the surgeons say I am better, they cannot lift me
from one bed to another without extraordinary pain”; and
three days later: “As I thought to be entering the haven,
a new tempest has driven me far away.” A fresh abscess
had appeared on his already crippled right arm. “To
console me, they talk of playing with knives again, on
which I shall find it hard to resolve, having neither strength
nor courage enough. I pray God to grant me these, that
I may conform to His will.” Two days later: “I suffered
extraordinary pain last night.... They have decided to
make an opening in the bend of the arm. But they fear
they may cut the vein. I am in the hand of God. I would
I had finished my testament, but I cannot do it without
you, and you cannot move till Perpignan is taken.”</p>

<p>The slight ease given by the operation lasted only a
few days, more abscesses forming; and it seems that the
Cardinal thought himself a dying man. M. de Noyers
having arrived at his pressing summons, Pierre Falconis,
notary-royal of the town of Narbonne, was employed to
write out that remarkable will of seventeen sheets which
shows his mind at its clearest and strongest. Madame
d’Aiguillon and M. de Noyers were his executors, and
among the witnesses were Cardinal Mazarin and Hardouin
de Péréfixe, his chamberlain, afterwards Archbishop of
Paris. Falconis attested that “mondit seigneur le Cardinal-Duc”
was unable, owing to the state of his right arm,
himself to sign his testament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>

<p>The end was not yet. The doctors advised a move
from the marshes and stagnant lakes of Narbonne to the
healthier air of Provence and the Rhône. Any ordinary
conveyance was impossible for the Cardinal’s pain-racked
body. He travelled in his bed, carried by eighteen men in
an immense litter hung with crimson and gold. So large,
we are told, was the “machine,” that gateways had to be
widened, doors and windows taken out, walls pulled down,
at the many stopping-places on His Eminence’s journey.
He was overtaken by bad news: the Maréchal de Guiche
had been defeated by the Spaniards near Cambray, and for
a few days there was great alarm in the north of France,
with new outcries against the Cardinal; his enemies were
even mad enough to accuse him of having arranged the
defeat in order to prove himself still necessary to France.
If this absurd report reached him, his already troubled
mind was soothed by a letter from the King, brought to
him at Arles by M. de Chavigny: “Je finiroy en vous
asseurant que quelque faux bruit qu’on fasse courre je vous
ayme plus que jamais et qu’il y a trop longtemps que nous
sommes ensemble pour nous jamais séparer ce que je veux
bien que tout le monde sache.”</p>

<p>Richelieu’s reply to that letter was to send the King,
by the hand of Chavigny, a copy or rough sketch of his
brother’s secret treaty with Spain.</p>

<p>By what means that copy reached him has been one
of the secrets of history. Among many guesses, Michelet
favours the story that Queen Anne, aware of the treaty,
took this means of making her peace with the Cardinal.
But it seems more likely, on the whole, that Richelieu’s
own spies at the Court of Madrid had made the discovery.
In any case it meant for him a final triumph.</p>

<p>At first the King was irresolute. Ill from the heat,
he had returned to Narbonne from the camp at Perpignan,
leaving the siege to his officers. Though he knew Cinq-Mars
to be a traitor, he did not at once arrest him, half
hoping, perhaps, that the “pauvre diable” might save his
life by escaping over the frontier. Fontrailles had already
done so, but Cinq-Mars, proud, foolhardy, confident in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
master’s affection, followed him to Narbonne. Urgent
letters to the King from the Cardinal decided his fate.
When too late he hid himself in a house at Narbonne;
the mistress had pity on his curly head, but her hard-hearted
husband denounced him; the royal guards seized
him and conveyed him to the castle of Montpellier. De
Thou, the least guilty of all and the first to be taken,
was sent to Tarascon, where Richelieu had already arrived.
The Duc de Bouillon, arrested at Casale, was brought
back to France and imprisoned at Lyons in the old
castle of Pierre-Encise, which in those days still dominated
the city.</p>

<p>The King’s illness disinclined him to linger in the
south, either for the conquest of Roussillon or for the
trial of traitors. On the very day of his favourite’s arrest
he left Narbonne for Fontainebleau, and stopped at
Tarascon for an interview with the Cardinal. Both were
so ill that Louis was carried on a bed into his Minister’s
room, and there, side by side, the rulers of France, neither
of whom had a year to live, discussed the Spanish treaty
and its authors. Louis gave them up, without conditions,
to the vengeance of Richelieu. He, assured of the King’s
eternal faith and affection, forgot bodily pain in mental
triumph, and was ready to take up, with all his old energy,
the full regal power and authority with which he found
himself suddenly invested. This extended not only to the
punishment of State criminals, but to the Spanish campaign
and the whole government of the south.</p>

<p>It seems that Bouillon and Cinq-Mars had a legal
loophole of escape. They appeared in the actual treaty
only as “deux seigneurs de qualité,” their names, with that
of Sedan, being added in a secret memorandum; Monsieur
and His Catholic Majesty of Spain were the only two persons
openly mentioned. The fate of his fellow-conspirators
therefore depended largely on Monsieur; and they, knowing
this, may well have despaired.</p>

<p>He was at Blois, “faisant le malade,” when the news
of the arrest of Cinq-Mars reached him. As a first precaution,
he burned the original treaty. Then, finding that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
all was known, he sent the Abbé de la Rivière to Richelieu
with letters of confession and grovelling entreaties for
pardon. Richelieu told the messenger that his master
deserved death, and might think himself fortunate if he
escaped with confiscation and banishment. He had no
longer the saving quality of being heir to the throne
of France. He was terribly frightened. The Cardinal,
with great show of severity, insisted that he should
renounce for ever all “charges and administrations” in
the kingdom, and should retire for the present, on a
pension, to Annecy in Savoy, after being confronted at
Lyons with his captive confederates. This trial the King
spared him; but he had to save himself by signing a
declaration that Messieurs de Bouillon and de Cinq-Mars
were in fact the two “seigneurs de qualité” to whom the
Spanish treaty referred.</p>

<p>Cinq-Mars and de Thou were brought to their trial at
Lyons. Rumour and gossip seem to have coloured too
highly the dramatic situation so often painted and described.
According to the story believed by Madame
de Motteville, M. de Montglat, and society generally, both
prisoners were conveyed by river, the boat in which they
travelled being towed by the great barge on which the
Cardinal had embarked in his gorgeous litter. As a fact,
it was de Thou alone who made part of this spectacle
of vindictive triumph, Cinq-Mars being fetched by a troop
of horse from Montpellier. The voyage against the swift
waters of the Rhone was long and slow. On each bank
a squadron of the Cardinal’s guards kept pace with the
boats. They left Tarascon on August 17, and did not
reach Lyons till September 3, when de Thou, with Cinq-Mars,
joined the Duc de Bouillon in the castle of Pierre-Encise.</p>

<p>Their trial began immediately; and for Cinq-Mars the
verdict was certain, even had not the jury been partly
composed of Richelieu’s own commissioners, notably that
Laubardemont who had for years been a name of terror
to his enemies. Chancellor Séguier, with a touch of
humanity, tried to save François de Thou: this gallant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
gentleman was plainly guiltless of any active conspiracy.
But there were old private grudges in his case, and
Richelieu’s state of mind and body made any hope of
mercy vain. Laubardemont, acting for him, brought up
an old law of Louis XI. which punished with death those
who knew of a plot without revealing it. This law had
seldom been carried out in full severity, but its existence
was enough to condemn the man who had been a too
faithful friend, and de Thou shared Cinq-Mars’ sentence.
The Duc de Bouillon saved his head by resigning his
strong fortress of Sedan to the King—“who much desired
it,” says Montglat, “because it was situated on the river
Meuse, and served as a retreat for all the malcontent.”</p>

<p>The sentence, pronounced on September 12, was carried
out that same day in the square of the Hôtel de Ville at
Lyons. Many writers have described the heroic calmness
with which the two young men met their death and the
universal pity and mourning throughout society. M. de
Montglat expresses the feeling of his order. “Thus died
M. le Grand, aged twenty-two years, handsome, well-made,
generous, liberal, and having all the parts of an <i>honnête
homme</i>, had he not been ungrateful to his benefactor, and
had he shown more judgment in his conduct. As to M. de
Thou, he was beloved of every one: he was indeed a man
of great merit, regretted by the whole Court, where many
believed that he was condemned without reason.”</p>

<p>Three days before the execution Perpignan opened its
gates to the French, and Cardinal de Richelieu, who left
Lyons for Paris as soon as the trial was over, wrote from
his first stage to M. de Chavigny: “These three words are
to tell you that Perpignan is in the King’s hands and that
M. le Grand and M. de Thou are in the other world, where
I pray God they may be happy.”</p>

<p>Louis XIII., we are told, received the news of his old
favourite’s death with equal heartlessness—“remembering
no more the friendship he had borne him and without any
feeling of compassion.”</p>

<p>Travelling in his great “machine,” the Cardinal made
his slow journey chiefly by canals and rivers. October<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
was advanced when he slept the last night at Fontainebleau,
embarked on the Seine, landed in Paris, and was borne on
to his retreat at Rueil, the Court being at Saint-Germain.</p>

<p>It was a triumphal return; his enemies were fallen;
and from every side news of fresh victories came to greet
the dying Minister who had given France her new place
among the nations.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The Cardinal’s last days—Renewed illness—His death and funeral—His
legacies—The feeling in France—The Church of the Sorbonne.</p>
</div>

<p>In the first days after Cardinal de Richelieu’s return
from the south, few persons, certainly not himself,
realized that his career was so near its end. The
doctors, however, knew what they were doing when they
healed the wounds in his arm; his chief surgeon remonstrated,
but to no purpose, for the Cardinal would have it
done. “He has dealt himself a mortal blow,” the surgeon
said to a friend.</p>

<p>For the moment, infirm as he was, he took a new hold
on life. During those autumn weeks at Rueil he was
eager, imperious, restless, suspicious, ever planning for the
future, in case he should survive the King; strangely
haughty, irritable, and nervous, insisting that his armed
guards should attend him everywhere, even in the royal
presence. Louis XIII., himself too ill and depressed to
enjoy his hunting as usual, was pestered by Chavigny and
de Noyers with messages from the Eminentissime, insisting
on the disgrace of four of his best-liked officers—among
whom was M. de Troisville, or Tréville, the famous captain
of musketeers—whose only crime was that they had
formerly been friends of Cinq-Mars, and that Richelieu
feared their hatred and their influence. The King resisted
long, but at last, by sheer angry obstinacy, the Cardinal
gained his point, and the four gentlemen were dismissed
from the Court, though not from the army; the King
showing “great displeasure, even to shedding of tears.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span></p>

<p>In November His Eminence moved from Rueil to the
Palais-Cardinal, and there, still magnificent though gloomy
of spirit and too ill to be actually present, he entertained
the Court with the performance of an “heroic comedy”
called <i>Europe</i>, partly his own, partly the work of Desmarets.
Here were celebrated the victories of France over Germany,
Spain, and her own internal disloyalties, as well as her
triumphs in art, commerce, and luxury. In truth, the
piece was a glorification of the ministry of Armand de
Richelieu.</p>

<p>It was not long before Nature took her revenge and
justified the doctors. “On Friday, November 28, 1642, in
the night,” says Aubery, “the Cardinal-Duc was attacked
by a great pain in his side with fever. On Sunday, the
pain and fever having much augmented, it was found
necessary to bleed him twice, and the Duchesse d’Aiguillon
and the Maréchaux de Brézé and de la Meilleraye decided
to sleep at the Palais-Cardinal.” On Monday morning the
Cardinal was better; but in the afternoon and night he
became so much worse, with difficulty of breathing, that
the doctors bled him again. On Tuesday the King ordered
special prayers in all the Paris churches, and came himself
from Saint-Germain to visit his dying Minister. Whether
sorry or glad, who knows! At this supreme hour, as all
through Richelieu’s career, there are contradictory accounts
of the relations between the two men. Aubery’s dignified
narrative shows us a gracious and sympathetic King, handing
nourishment to the invalid, listening with sorrowful
attention to the last counsels of the statesman who had led
him and France so far, and who now, while reminding
His Majesty of his past services and recommending his
family and friends to his care, was chiefly concerned that
Monsieur should have no share, now or ever, in the
government, and that Cardinal Mazarin, the fittest of all
the present Ministers, should take up the burden which
must be laid down. For it was plain to Richelieu himself,
as well as to King, friends, and physicians, that he had not
many hours to live.</p>

<p>Louis did more than listen to the Cardinal’s dying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
prayers and counsels; he respected them. But gossips
and memoir-writers agree that he left the Palais-Cardinal
“fort gai,” laughing and joking with the Cardinal’s relations
and admiring the splendours of the great house which
now, by his will, was to become royal property.</p>

<p>When the King was gone, Richelieu asked his physicians
how long he had to live. They replied evasively—they
could not tell; there was no cause to despair, and so forth.
Then he called for M. Chicot, the King’s physician, and
told him to answer truly, not as doctor, but as friend.
Chicot gave him twenty-four hours. “C’est parler, cela!”
said Richelieu, and sent for the Curé of Saint-Eustache,
his parish church, to receive his confession and to administer
the last Sacraments.</p>

<p>“Treat me as the meanest of your parishioners,” he
said to the priest; and the crowd in his room could hear,
through their own sobs, the voice of their master repeating
<i>Pater</i> and <i>Credo</i>, joining in prayers, declaring his faith in
God and the Church, answering to the question whether
he forgave his enemies: “I have had no enemies but those
of the State.” It was a bold assertion from the lips of such
a man, and the Bishop of Lisieux, standing by, was startled
by the confident words. But one may very well imagine
that Armand de Richelieu believed it of himself.</p>

<p>On Wednesday the doctors, having bled him again, the
pain and fever growing steadily worse, made their bows
and retired; they could do no more. A country quack
was then allowed to try his skill: many such, probably,
haunted the gates of the palace; but this man, Le Fèvre
by name, had some friend at Court who admitted him to
the sick-room, and the Cardinal did not refuse his remedies.
At first they seemed successful. Soothing draughts
and opium pills lulled the sharp pain, and when the King,
who had remained at the Louvre, paid his second visit in
the afternoon, the Cardinal appeared slightly better. The
gossips say that Louis departed “less joyful.”</p>

<p>A quiet night brought so calm a morning—Thursday,
December 4, 1642—that the Cardinal’s own people began
to rejoice in the hope of his recovery; and if the doctors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
knowing better, shook their heads, M. Le Fèvre had his
moment of triumph. But the patient himself was not
deceived.</p>

<p>Those to whom he gave audience in the course of that
morning—gentlemen sent by the Queen and Monsieur—listened
to the words of a dying man. Only on his
death-bed assuredly would Richelieu have humbly begged
Anne’s pardon for any causes of grievance which, “in the
course of our lives,” she might have had against him.</p>

<p>“A little before noon,” says Aubery, “he felt extraordinarily
weak, and perceiving thus that his end infallibly
drew near, he said, with a tranquil countenance, to the
Duchesse d’Aiguillon: ‘My niece, I am very ill; I am
going to die; I pray you to leave me. Your tenderness
affects me. Do not suffer the pain of seeing me die.’”</p>

<p>She, the person he had loved best, left him unwillingly
and in tears, and his confessor was instantly called to say
the prayers for the dying. A few minutes of unconsciousness,
then two heavy sighs, and Cardinal de Richelieu was
dead.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He was only fifty-seven; but the worn face, wasted
body and whitened hair were those of a much older man.
The Parisians came in immense crowds to look on him
as he lay in state at the Palais-Cardinal, where the royal
guards, even before he was dead, had replaced his own.
He lay on a bed of brocade in his magnificent Cardinal’s
robes and cap, with the ducal coronet and mantle at his
feet. The captain of his guards, M. de Bar, sat in deep
mourning at his right hand; and on either side, by the
light of many tall wax tapers in great silver candlesticks,
a double choir of monks intoned psalms perpetually.</p>

</figure>

<p>On the evening of December 13 “the body of the
Cardinal-Duc was transported from his palace to the
Church of the Sorbonne on a magnificent car, covered with
a great pall of black velvet crossed with white satin and
enriched with the arms of His Eminence, embroidered in
gold and silver—the six horses which drew it entirely
covered with drapery of the same—surrounded by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
pages, each holding a large candle of white wax, preceded
and followed by so great a quantity of the same lights,
which were carried and borne before the relations, connexions,
friends, servants, and officers of the deceased, who
were present in coaches, on horseback, and on foot, that
the evening of the day on which that funeral took place
was brighter than the noon: the wide streets of this city
being found too narrow for the innumerable crowds of
people by which they were lined, as in the greatest and
most august ceremonies.”</p>

<p>So far the <i>Gazette de France</i>. With every mark, as it
seems, of outward respect, the gleaming cavalcade made
its way through the darkness of the city. They carried
him over the Pont Neuf, where Henry’s statue commanded
Paris and the Seine, and up the hill, through the old
University quarter for which he had done so much, and
laid him in the vault he had prepared for himself and his
family under the stately new Church of the Sorbonne.
His funeral ceremonies extended for weeks, far into the
following year, with grand state services at Notre Dame
and solemn requiems in all the churches of Paris. A long
and flattering epitaph, engraved on copper and fastened
to the wall of the crypt where he lay, was meant to keep
his fame alive till France herself should be no more. It
began: “Icy repose le grand Armand-Jean du Plessis,
Cardinal de Richelieu, Duc et Pair de France: Grand en
naissance, grand en esprit, grand en sagesse, grand en
science, grand en courage, grand en fortune, mais plus
grand encore en piété....” After describing the hero’s
fine deeds and wonderful qualities, his genius, grace, and
majesty, the epitaph—said to have been composed by
Georges de Scudéry—went on to announce that “il est
mort comme il a vécu, grand, invincible, glorieux et pour
dernier honneur, pleuré de son Roi; et pour son éternel
bonheur, il est mort humblement, chrétiennement et
saintement....”</p>

<p>It was not till towards the end of the century that the
marble tomb by Girardon was placed above the vault in
the Church of the Sorbonne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>By his will, made at Narbonne, the Cardinal confirmed
the promised gift he had made to the Crown in 1636 of the
Palais-Cardinal, most of his magnificent gold and silver
plate, diamonds, and a large sum of money. He divided
his lands, châteaux, and other property between his nephew
and great-nephews and Madame d’Aiguillon, leaving the
lion’s share with his name and title, as has been said, to
Armand de Vignerot, who was also entrusted with his
precious library. Many of his artistic treasures and all his
remaining jewellery went to Madame d’Aiguillon. With
the most particular care and in the strongest words he
guarded against any future dismemberment of the estates
he left to his family. Fortunate for him that his fame and
honour did not depend on the châteaux, the gardens, the
forests, the collections and possessions of every kind
which had so long shared his thoughts with France and
her glory.</p>

<p>The legacies to his servants and humbler friends showed
the Cardinal in his pleasantest light, as a just and generous
master. Not one was forgotten, from his chaplains, officers
and gentlemen, his secretaries and <i>le petit</i> Mulot, secretary’s
clerk, to cooks, grooms, muleteers, and footmen. The
smallest legacy was six years’ wages. That he did not
forget past benefits was shown by a legacy to a M. de
Broyé, the necessitous nephew of that Claude Barbin
who had helped him to his place in the Ministry in the
days of the Maréchal d’Ancre.</p>

<p>“He was extremely regretted,” says Montglat, “by his
relations, friends, and servants, who were numerous; for he
was the best master, relation, or friend that ever was; and
provided that he was convinced a man loved him, his
fortune was made; for he never forsook those who attached
themselves to him.” At the same time, he was personally
solitary and inaccessible, and after the death of Père Joseph,
though surrounded by those whom loyalty or interest kept
faithful to him, no man could call himself his intimate
friend.</p>

<p>“Il est mort un grand politique”—a great politician
is dead: these were the short cold words with which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
Louis XIII. honoured the memory of the man who had
“raised France to her highest point since Charlemagne;
crushed the Huguenot party, which had rebelled against
five kings; humbled the House of Austria, which claimed
to be the law-giver of Christendom; and established the
King’s power so firmly, by subduing the princes, that
nothing in the kingdom could resist him any more.”</p>

<p>As a King, there is no doubt that Louis regretted his
great Minister; he had proved over and over again that he
knew how to value the statesman who had given him new
authority and France new prestige; he had proved it to the
bitter cost of those who reckoned on his personal impatience,
as a man, of the yoke laid upon him by a tyrannical and
worrying tutor. That yoke was now removed; and though
the King appeared to be Richelieu’s chief mourner, while
following his last counsels and carrying out his policy,
contemporaries were very sure that in the depths of his
soul he was glad to be rid of him.</p>

<p>France, as a whole, drew a long breath of relief and joy.
It was not only “les grands du royaume,” soon to be flocking
back from prison and from exile, Monsieur, appearing
once more at Court, the Duc de Vendôme, leaving his refuge
in England, who welcomed their freedom from the political
terror which had weighed down their gay lives; it was also
the people of lower degree, citizens, peasants, who had felt
the oppression of Richelieu’s heavy taxes. They had paid
for his wars by pinching and starvation; for his objects
they cared little, the vision of most of them being naturally
bounded by their own parish. All through the provinces,
in the villages, in the towns, large and small, even in Paris
itself, blazing bonfires lit up the winter nights when the
Eminentissime lay dead.</p>

<p>That well-known <i>rondeau</i> was one of the mildest among
the satirical poems full of hatred, violence, and indecency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
which circulated in society after the death of him whom
they called “le ministre des enfers.” And if his countrymen
had listened for an echo of their rejoicing, they might
have heard it in the “great contentment” of the enemies of
France.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Cardinal de Richelieu’s noblest monument in Paris is
his stately building of the Sorbonne. His resting-place in
the crypt of its Church was disturbed in the Revolution,
and his bones were scattered, but his embalmed face-mask
was preserved by reverent hands and ultimately replaced
in his tomb. The Church is no longer used for worship;
but Armand de Richelieu still reclines there in marble
peace. His eyes are raised to the heaven in which he
certainly believed. He is supported in his mortal weakness
by Religion, holding the book he wrote, when Bishop of
Luçon, in defence of the Catholic Faith; and Science—in
the likeness of his beloved niece, Madame d’Aiguillon—lies
mourning at his feet.</p>
